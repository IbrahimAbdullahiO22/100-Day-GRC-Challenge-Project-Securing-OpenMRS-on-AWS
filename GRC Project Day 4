# 📅 Day 4 – Compliance: Following Rules (but Not Confusing Them with Security) | 100 Days of GRC

##  What I’ve Learned and Now Teach About Compliance

Today’s lesson in GRC reinforced a key truth I emphasize often as a cybersecurity and GRC leader:

> **Compliance ≠ Security.**

Compliance means following the **laws, regulations, and required standards** — like HIPAA in healthcare, PCI DSS for payments, or GDPR for personal data.

But being compliant is not the same as being secure.

- Compliance is the floor — the bare minimum we must do to avoid legal penalties, fines, and breaches of trust.
- True security is the ceiling — going beyond checklists to actively protect what matters.

##  Why Compliance Still Matters — But Isn’t Enough

Take HIPAA for example. It requires healthcare organizations to:

 Conduct risk analysis  
 Limit access to ePHI  
 Encrypt data when appropriate  
 Train staff on security  
 Respond to incidents

But HIPAA doesn’t tell you *exactly how* to secure your OpenMRS server on AWS. That’s on us as security professionals.

One real-world failure sticks with me:

**Lifespan Health System** — fined over **$1 million** when a single unencrypted laptop was stolen. Thousands of patient records exposed. Why? They didn’t follow HIPAA’s “addressable” encryption requirements — a clear compliance gap.

They had policies… but failed to implement practical security.

Lesson: **compliance without action leads to risk** — and patient harm.

##  Teaching Point for My Team

When deploying something like OpenMRS in healthcare:

 **Compliance** helps avoid fines and legal risks.  
 **Security** helps prevent patient harm and protect trust.  
 **Good governance** ensures we don’t just aim for the minimum — we bake security into the culture.

As a GRC leader, I guide teams to **exceed compliance** — using it as a starting point, not the finish line.

## 🛠️ Hands-On Example (HIPAA Requirement)

I looked at HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) — “Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities…”

For an OpenMRS-on-AWS deployment:

- I would ensure that **regular risk assessments** are conducted — including checking patch levels, encryption status, access controls, and audit logs.
- This assessment wouldn’t just be for compliance — it would drive **continuous improvement** in protecting ePHI.

That’s the bridge from compliance → real security.

##  Reflection

In my experience, I’ve seen many organizations treat compliance as a box-checking exercise. 

One former employer mandated **annual phishing training**. People clicked through the videos without learning. When a real phishing attack hit… users still clicked.

Why? Compliance was treated as “we have to,” not “this matters.”

That’s why as a GRC leader, I foster **security awareness**, not just compliance. People need to *care* — not just comply.

---

## Final Thought

**Compliance protects the organization.  
Security protects the patients.**

Both matter — but if we want trust and resilience, we must lead with security-first thinking, informed by compliance requirements — not limited by them.

## What’s Next?

Tomorrow I’ll explore how Governance, Risk, and Compliance **work together** — and show how a strong encryption policy in OpenMRS can tie G, R, and C into one cohesive approach.
