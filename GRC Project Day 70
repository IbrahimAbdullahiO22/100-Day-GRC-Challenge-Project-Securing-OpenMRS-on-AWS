#  Day 70: Task M-2 – Ongoing Assessments (Regular Security Checkups)

Welcome to **Day 70** of my 100-Day GRC journey!  

Yesterday, I focused on detecting system and environment changes (Task M-1). Today, I’m moving deeper into the **Monitor** phase of the RMF with **Task M-2: Ongoing Assessments**.  

This is where I shift from watching **for change** to validating that my **security controls** are still doing their job. It’s one thing to deploy controls; it’s another to ensure they’re effective over time. This task is about performing regular, proactive **security health checks** — long before an auditor or attacker shows up.

##  Why Ongoing Assessments Matter

Even if your system *seems* fine, risks can quietly accumulate.  

- Configurations drift  
- Patches are missed  
- Roles and permissions expand  
- New vulnerabilities emerge  

By scheduling **routine checkups**, I maintain **assurance** that the controls I’ve documented in my System Security Plan (SSP) are **still valid** and functioning as intended.

This is not about paranoia — it’s about building a culture of **continuous validation and readiness**.

##  Applying Ongoing Assessments to OpenMRS on AWS

Let’s explore what this looks like for my **OpenMRS deployment in AWS**:

###  1. Vulnerability Scanning

- **Tool**: AWS Inspector or open-source options like OpenVAS  
- **Frequency**: Monthly, or upon major updates  
- **Goal**: Identify new OS or application vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs in OpenMRS or Tomcat)  
- **Action**: Feed results into the POA&M or patch pipeline  

---

###  2. Manual Control Reviews

- **Backup validation**: Confirm backup jobs ran successfully and restore points are functional  
- **Access control audit**: Review IAM roles, group memberships, and ensure least privilege is maintained  
- **Encryption review**: Validate that S3 buckets, databases, and snapshots are encrypted per policy  
- **Log retention**: Ensure CloudTrail and OpenMRS logs are stored and protected  

---

###  3. Compliance Spot Checks

If HIPAA or other frameworks apply:

- **Audit logs**: Are access logs still enabled and reviewed regularly?  
- **User activity monitoring**: Are we detecting suspicious behaviors?  
- **Data handling procedures**: Are PHI records still masked when required?

##  Integrating Ongoing Assessments into Operations

To make these assessments sustainable, I’m building them into standard operating procedures:

| Assessment Area         | Frequency         | Responsible Role          |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Vulnerability Scanning  | Monthly           | Security Analyst           |
| IAM/User Audit          | Quarterly         | System Owner + GRC Lead    |
| Backup Restore Test     | Quarterly         | Infrastructure Engineer    |
| HIPAA Spot Checks       | Biannually        | Privacy Officer + GRC Team |
| Firewall Rule Review    | Quarterly         | Network Engineer           |
| Encryption Checks       | Quarterly         | Security Architect         |

These routines are tracked in our **continuous monitoring plan** and updated in the GRC tool.

##  Reflection

If I were leading the security of OpenMRS, here’s what I’d prioritize in my **routine checkups**:

1. **Patch Management**: Is the latest OpenMRS version deployed? Have we patched Log4j-type vulnerabilities recently?
2. **Access Control Reviews**: Are all user accounts still required? Have any privileged accounts gone stale?
3. **Backup and Restore Validation**: Could we recover production data within RTO/RPO targets?
4. **Firewall & Security Group Audit**: Are AWS ports still restricted per policy?
5. **Encryption Compliance**: Are KMS keys rotated and used correctly for all sensitive data?

By doing these checks regularly, I build **muscle memory**, identify drift early, and reduce risk without waiting for a crisis.

##  Today’s Goal

Recognize the **importance of proactive security validation**.  
Controls are not “set and forget.” They degrade without oversight. Regular assessments create operational maturity and build trust with auditors, leadership, and users.

##  Teaser for Day 71

Tomorrow, I’ll move into **Task M-3 – Ongoing Risk Response**, where I translate assessment findings into **real action**. Scans and reviews are only useful if they result in smart, timely decisions.  

Stay tuned as I continue turning GRC knowledge into real-world impact.
