#  Day 72: Task M-4 – Keeping the Docs Updated (Authorization Package)

Welcome to **Day 72** of my 100-Day GRC journey!  

Now that our system has been continuously monitored and improved, it’s time for one of the most important — yet often overlooked — parts of maintaining a secure and auditable system: **updating the authorization package**.  

This is **Task M-4** in the NIST RMF: keeping the **System Security Plan (SSP)**, **Risk Assessment Report**, and **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)** current. These documents are the living memory of the system’s security posture — and just like the system itself, they must evolve.

##  What I’ve Learned

Security is not static — and neither is documentation.

If your team works hard to fix vulnerabilities, implement new controls, and adapt to changing environments, but your documentation still reflects the system from 9 months ago… that’s a risk in itself.

Keeping documentation up-to-date ensures that:
- **Auditors** have an accurate view of the system
- **Leadership** can make informed risk decisions
- **New team members** can onboard more quickly
- **Continuous monitoring** is supported with integrity

## Real-World Example: OpenMRS on AWS

Let’s say we’re running **OpenMRS** in AWS. Over the past few weeks, we:

- **Enabled MFA** for admin accounts  
- **Closed out a critical vulnerability** found in Nessus  
- **Moved the backend database** to another AWS region for disaster recovery

Each of these actions requires an update to our documentation:

| Change Made | Document to Update | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------|-------|
| Enabled MFA | SSP | Update the `IA-2 (Identification and Authentication)` control section to reflect implementation |
| Patched SQL vuln | POA&M | Mark the item as "Remediated" and add a remediation date + summary |
| Database moved | SSP + Network Diagram | Update the architecture overview and data flow to reflect new region |

This ensures the **SSP** tells the current truth, the **POA&M** reflects active and resolved risks, and any **SAR** (Security Assessment Report) findings stay in sync with reality.

##  Why It Matters

Failing to update your security docs is like relying on an old map to navigate a city that's changed — you're bound to make wrong turns.

**Risks of outdated documentation:**

- Audit findings (non-compliance due to inaccurate SSP)
- Confusion during incident response ("Are we logging that service?")
- Poor decision-making ("I didn’t know the data center changed!")
- Delayed ATO renewals or re-assessments

Keeping your docs current is one of the **simplest but most powerful ways** to maintain trust, transparency, and operational readiness.

##  Today’s Goal

Understand that the **authorization package is a living set of documents**, not a one-time deliverable. It must change as your system and risk environment do.

Every configuration update, control enhancement, vulnerability fix, or architecture change is a signal: **update the docs**.

---

##  Reflection

If we **never updated** our system's SSP, POA&M, or SAR, it would be like locking the doors and leaving the keys under the mat — giving us a false sense of security.

Imagine this:
> A team member refers to the SSP to confirm that OpenMRS logs access to patient data — but logging was disabled during a patch and never turned back on. No one knew because the docs said otherwise. That could be a **HIPAA violation**, and worse — a patient trust breach.

Documentation is a form of **security communication** — it has to be **current, clear, and continuous**.

##  What’s Next?

Tomorrow, in **Day 73**, I’ll dive into **Security Status Reporting** – the art of communicating system security health to leadership, auditors, and stakeholders. If today is about keeping the house clean, tomorrow is about **showing the receipts**.

Let’s keep pushing forward, staying proactive, transparent, and accountable in all things GRC.
