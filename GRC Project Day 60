# Day 60 – Task A-3 (Part 2): Perform Control Assessments (Process & Documentation)

Welcome to **Day 60** of my GRC journey! 

Yesterday, I assessed the *technical controls* of our OpenMRS-on-AWS deployment. Today, I’m shifting focus to **non-technical controls** — specifically the policies, procedures, and human factors that support the system's security posture.

This is the second half of **Task A-3** in the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). It’s time to examine documentation and interview stakeholders to ensure **what’s written on paper is truly being practiced**.

---

##  Today’s Goals

- **Understand** non-technical assessments (policy, procedure, training, etc.)  
- **Apply** the `Examine` and `Interview` methods from NIST SP 800-53A  
- **Validate** process controls for OpenMRS on AWS  
- **Collect evidence** to support each assessed control

---

##  What Are Non-Technical Assessments?

Security is not just about servers and firewalls — it’s about **people, policies, and process**.

In NIST terms:

- **Examine** = Read and verify documented procedures, plans, logs  
- **Interview** = Speak to key personnel to confirm understanding and implementation  

Together, these give a full view of whether a control is real, relevant, and reliable.

##  Example: What I Reviewed for OpenMRS

### 1. Policy & Procedure Documents (Examine)

I reviewed:

- **Access Control Policy** – defines least privilege, MFA requirements  
- **Incident Response Plan** – includes roles, communication steps, escalation paths  
- **Backup & Recovery SOP** – outlines daily backups to S3 and monthly restore drills  
- **Security Awareness Training Logs** – tracked completion across user roles  

What I looked for:

| Control | Artifact | What I Verified |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| AC-1 | Access Control Policy | Existence, version control, and references to AWS IAM |
| IR-4 | Incident Response Plan | Clear chain-of-command and incident types |
| CP-9 | Backup Policy | Snapshot logs, retention policy |
| AT-4 | Training Records | Completion certificates for all OpenMRS users |

---

###  2. Interviews With Stakeholders (Interview)

I conducted simulated interviews with:

- **System Admin** – to verify user provisioning and deactivation procedures  
- **Cloud Engineer** – to explain how backup automation is implemented  
- **HR/Training Coordinator** – to confirm onboarding includes HIPAA/security training  

> *Example Interview Question:*  
> “Walk me through how you disabled a user account after someone left the organization.”  
>  
> *Expected Answer:*  
> “We disable the account in OpenMRS, remove the IAM role in AWS, and log it in our offboarding checklist.”

## 🔍 Gathering Evidence of Control Implementation

Here’s the kind of **evidence** I collected to confirm process implementation:

| Control | Evidence Type | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| AC-2 | User audit log | Showed last account review (with timestamps) |
| CP-10 | Backup Logs | S3 snapshots taken daily via AWS Backup |
| IR-8 | Drill Report | Tabletop exercise summary, conducted quarterly |
| AT-4 | Training Records | Excel export of completed training sessions, with dates and signatures |

> ✳️ **Pro tip:** Screenshots, export files, and meeting minutes are excellent evidence sources.

##  10-Minute Hands-On Exercise

###  Step 1: Select a Security Document

I chose the `Incident Response Plan` for OpenMRS on AWS.

###  Step 2: Match to Real-World Practice

The plan says:  
> “All incidents must be escalated within 30 minutes of detection.”

I checked our ticketing system and confirmed:  
- We had a documented incident last month  
- The timestamp showed the incident was escalated within 15 minutes  
- An after-action review was conducted

 **Control verified**

---

###  Step 3: Write 3 Interview Questions

1. *“How do you know when an incident is severe enough to escalate?”*  
2. *“Have you participated in an incident drill this quarter? What did you learn?”*  
3. *“Can you describe the last time a backup was restored?”*

These help test both knowledge and actual adherence to the process.

##  Reflection

> “It’s one thing to have a beautiful policy. It’s another to *live it*.”

Through these interviews and reviews, I identified small gaps — like outdated backup procedures and one missing training log. It was a reminder that **policy without practice introduces risk**.

- `NIST SP 800-53A examine interview test`  
- `Security documentation audit checklist`  
- `Evidence for security control implementation`  
- `Policy vs practice compliance gap`  
- `IT security assessment interviews best practices`

## Tomorrow’s Focus

**Day 61** will walk through creating a **Security Assessment Report (SAR)**. We’ll tie together everything learned so far — from evidence collection to risk ratings — and prepare to brief stakeholders for authorization decisions.
