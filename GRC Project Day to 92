#  Day 92: Capstone Part 6 – Training and Awareness Program 

##  Objective

Today, I focused on developing the **Security Training and Awareness Program** for the OpenMRS deployment hosted on AWS. The goal is to ensure that **everyone — from front-line clinic staff to system administrators — understands their role** in keeping the system secure, compliant with HIPAA, and resilient against human error.

Even the most secure systems can be compromised by a single careless click, weak password, or failure to report suspicious activity. That’s why **user education is not optional — it’s a strategic layer of defense.**

## � Training Goals by Role

We’ve designed the training program with **two primary user groups** in mind:

###  General Users (Doctors, Nurses, Medical Assistants, Clerks)

Topics to be covered:

- **Password Hygiene**: Strong password creation, avoiding reuse, no sticky notes!
- **Workstation Security**: Locking sessions, logging out when stepping away
- **Phishing Awareness**: Identifying and reporting suspicious emails or messages
- **Patient Data Privacy**: Understanding HIPAA obligations and personal accountability
- **Incident Reporting**: How and when to escalate concerns to IT/security

Goal: Help end-users adopt secure habits that become **second nature**, without disrupting their clinical duties.

---

###  Technical Users (System Admins, IT Staff, DevOps)

In addition to general user topics, admins will receive advanced technical training:

- **Secure Server and App Management**: Patch management for OpenMRS and OS
- **AWS Security Fundamentals**: IAM roles, security groups, bucket permissions
- **Audit Logging & Monitoring**: Interpreting logs, detecting anomalies
- **Incident Response Execution**: Aligning with IRP (Incident Response Plan)
- **Backup & Recovery Operations**: Restoration procedures and validation testing

Goal: Equip technical staff to protect, detect, and respond to threats effectively — from the infrastructure layer up.

##  Training Program Structure

- **Onboarding Training**: Required for all new users before accessing OpenMRS
- **Annual Security Refresher**: Covers HIPAA updates, security best practices, policy changes
- **Quarterly Awareness Campaigns**: Themed newsletters, posters, or email tips
- **Phishing Simulation Drills**: Simulated phishing emails with just-in-time education
- **Role-Based Training Modules**: Custom content tailored to job responsibilities

##  Hands-On Training Activity: *Phishing Drill & Awareness Campaign*

###  Title: “Click Smart, Stay Safe” – Quarterly Phishing Simulation

**Objective**: Improve email security hygiene by simulating real-world phishing attacks in a safe, educational environment.

**How It Works**:
- A realistic but fake phishing email is sent to OpenMRS users.
- Users who click the link are redirected to a training page that highlights the red flags they missed.
- All results are anonymized and compiled into a quarterly security report.
- A follow-up newsletter shares helpful tips and success stories (e.g., “15 staff members reported the phishing email — great job!”).

**Who Participates**: All OpenMRS users (clinical, admin, and IT staff)

**Why It Matters**:
Healthcare organizations are high-value targets for phishing. Teaching staff how to recognize deception **before** a real attack occurs reduces the likelihood of compromise and encourages a culture of curiosity and caution.

##  Reflection – Building a Human Firewall

While firewalls and encryption are vital, **people are often the first and last line of defense.**

Many users:
- Are busy and may find security tasks annoying or confusing
- Aren’t trained to detect subtle threats like spear phishing
- Don’t realize how impactful their actions are on system integrity

That’s why I believe training must be:
- **Relevant** (linked to real-world situations)
- **Engaging** (interactive scenarios, storytelling, gamification)
- **Reinforced** (not a one-time course — ongoing touchpoints)

From my experience, the training that sticks includes **simulations**, **short videos with real consequences**, and **team-based competitions** ("Who can spot the phishing email fastest?").

One well-trained staff member who reports a phishing attempt or avoids downloading data to personal devices could literally save the entire system from breach or non-compliance.

>  *Takeaway*: Security awareness isn’t an add-on. It’s an embedded mindset — and culture always beats policy alone.
