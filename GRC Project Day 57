# 🔍 Day 57 – Who Ya Gonna Call? (Selecting the Right Security Assessor)
_100 Days of GRC – OpenMRS on AWS_

---

##  Task A-1: Assessor Selection

We’ve entered the **Assess** phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework, and Day 57 focuses on the foundational step: **choosing the right assessor**. After designing, implementing, and documenting controls for OpenMRS-on-AWS, it’s time to invite an **independent, qualified professional** to evaluate the system.

This post walks through not just how to select an assessor, but how to **think like a leader** — making risk-informed, ethics-rooted, and collaborative choices that strengthen both compliance and culture.

##  Why Assessor Independence Matters

I’ve been involved from Day 1 in designing, hardening, and documenting our OpenMRS system on AWS. But that proximity can lead to **blind spots**. No matter how experienced you are, self-assessing a system you helped build risks unintentional bias. That’s why **independence** is essential.

> You wouldn’t let a developer test their own code in production.
> So why let a system owner validate their own security posture?

NIST RMF (and frameworks like FedRAMP) emphasize independence to ensure credibility, objectivity, and transparency. An independent assessor acts like a referee — fair, but firm — ensuring the controls actually work, not just look good on paper.

##  What Makes a Good Assessor?

Here’s the checklist I use when evaluating potential assessors:

###  Technical Competence
- **Understands AWS services** (IAM, CloudTrail, EC2, RDS, WAF)
- **Knows healthcare IT** and security priorities (e.g., PHI protection, HIPAA safeguards)
- Familiar with **OpenMRS** or similar EHRs
- Holds relevant certifications: **CISA**, **CISSP**, **AWS Security Specialty**

###  RMF/NIST Knowledge
- Practical experience with **NIST 800-53** and **800-53A** controls  
- Understands how to assess **Access Control (AC)**, **Audit Logging (AU)**, etc.  
- Familiar with how assessments map to **risk posture**

###  Independence
- Was **not involved** in implementing OpenMRS
- Is **organizationally separate** from the development or DevSecOps team
- If internal, comes from audit or GRC team; if external, no prior engagement as a system integrator

###  Communication and Collaboration
- Can clearly explain findings and walk through technical logic
- Uses constructive, solution-focused language  
- Not a “gotcha” assessor — but also doesn’t sugarcoat gaps

###  Trustworthiness & Confidentiality
- Will see sensitive configuration details and possibly PHI
- Must respect boundaries, sign NDAs, and demonstrate discretion  
- Has a reputation for professionalism

##  Who Might Assess OpenMRS on AWS?

Depending on your org, here are three models that could work:

### 1. **Internal Assessor (Independent Team)**
- Example: Your hospital’s internal **IT audit team**
- Pro: Low cost, internal familiarity
- Con: May lack AWS/OpenMRS depth if not trained

### 2. **Peer Review (Community-Driven)**
- Example: Security engineer from another OpenMRS implementation
- Pro: Domain-specific insights
- Con: May lack formality, independence depending on affiliation

### 3. **External Consultant / 3PAO**
- Example: A firm like **CyberSecure Inc.** or **AWS Partner**
- Pro: High independence, formal reporting, certified assessors
- Con: Costly, may require coordination

##  What I’d Provide to the Assessor

As part of assessor onboarding, I’d prepare a package to help them plan efficiently:

###  Assessor “Intro Kit” Checklist:
-  **Updated System Security Plan (SSP)**
-  **Network Diagram** of OpenMRS on AWS
-  **Architecture Diagram** (e.g., EC2, RDS, S3 flow)
-  **IAM Role Mapping + MFA Reports**
-  **Access Control Policy**
-  **Security Awareness Training Records**
-  **Incident Response Plan**
-  **Backup & Restore Procedures**
-  **POA&M Tracker** (if applicable)
-  **Contact List** (System Owner, Admin, Compliance Officer)

This transparency builds trust and sets the tone for a **professional and productive assessment**.

## Potential Assessor Options (Hypothetical)

### 🅰 Option A: Alice, Internal IT Auditor
- Strength: Certified CISA, 8 years in IT risk, independent of OpenMRS team
- Weakness: Limited AWS experience
- Independence:  Yes
- Consideration: Pair with cloud SME for AWS review

### 🅱 Option B: CyberSecure Inc. (Consulting Firm)
- Strength: Conducts HIPAA & FedRAMP audits; AWS-certified engineers
- Weakness: Requires contract, budget approval
- Independence:  Yes
- Consideration: Good for external objectivity and documentation polish

##  Reflection

I see the value now in bringing in an assessor early — not just as a “checkpoint,” but as a **partner in strengthening resilience**. It can feel vulnerable to have someone critique your work, but it’s ultimately empowering. Better an assessor catch the weakness than a malicious actor.

> Independence isn’t just about compliance — it’s about earning **confidence** in your system.

This process reminds me that leadership in GRC isn’t just about technical skills — it’s about **inviting scrutiny**, **facilitating transparency**, and building a system that’s not only compliant, but credible.

##  Hands-On Summary

- Identified 2 qualified assessor options (internal and external)
- Evaluated each for independence and relevant expertise
- Created a draft “assessor intro kit” with key documentation for handoff

##  Coming Tomorrow: Assessment Planning (Task A-2)

Tomorrow we dive into planning the actual assessment. What controls will be tested? How? When? It’s like crafting the script for a security evaluation — and it’s a critical step in ensuring the review is targeted, evidence-based, and efficient. Let’s keep pushing forward! 🎯
