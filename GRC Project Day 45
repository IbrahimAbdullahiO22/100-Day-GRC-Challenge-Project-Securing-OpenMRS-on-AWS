## 🧾 Making It Official: The Power of Review

I’ve come to learn that in GRC, **no risk judgment stands alone**. That’s why Task C-3 matters. Today, I led the review and formal approval process for our OpenMRS security categorization — and here’s why this step is more than just a rubber stamp.

We had already done the hard thinking:

- **Confidentiality**: MODERATE (PHI exposure = legal, ethical, and reputational harm)
- **Integrity**: MODERATE (clinical decisions rely on accurate records)
- **Availability**: MODERATE (disruption = care delays but not catastrophic)

That made our overall system categorization MODERATE. But before moving forward, I submitted our findings for review by the **Authorizing Official (AO)** and our **Privacy Officer** — two key voices of reason and responsibility.

##  Why This Review Matters

As a GRC practitioner, I see categorization as the foundation — and **you don’t build a secure structure without validating the blueprint**.

The AO ensures:
- The categorization aligns with organizational risk appetite
- Our rationale is strong and documented
- There’s consistency with similar systems across the org

The Privacy Officer ensures:
- We’ve respected PHI risk
- Legal and regulatory obligations (e.g., HIPAA) are reflected in our confidentiality rating

If either sees a red flag, we revisit our assumptions — because **misclassifying the system is the easiest way to get security wrong at scale**.

##  How I Framed the Conversation

When I presented the categorization, I came prepared:

> “OpenMRS stores and processes PHI. We’ve assessed that any breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability would have a serious — but not catastrophic — impact on patient care and operations. Therefore, we’ve categorized the system as MODERATE overall, following the high-water mark principle under FIPS 199.”

We discussed:

- System dependencies (Are there redundancies in place?)
- Regulatory thresholds (Would HIPAA demand a HIGH categorization?)
- Operational realities (Can the clinic operate during downtime?)

In this case, our reasoning held up — and **the AO approved our categorization**. The Privacy Officer concurred with our confidentiality impact level, confirming it met PHI handling standards.

##  Why This Step Reflects Leadership

Review and sign-off aren’t about permission. They’re about **alignment and accountability**.

- By leading this review, I demonstrated **transparency** in our risk process.
- I invited feedback that could make the system more secure — even if it meant revising our work.
- Most of all, I created a **record of informed consensus**. Now, as we move into the Select step, no one’s guessing how critical OpenMRS is.

In regulated environments, *assumption is risk*. That’s why C-3 is a governance control in itself.

##  Reflection

This reminded me that **true risk leaders welcome scrutiny**. It’s easy to work in a silo and assume you’re right. But great security programs are **built collaboratively**.

I’ve seen firsthand how a second opinion on categorization can catch blind spots. It’s not about ego — it’s about getting it right. And in healthcare, getting it right means safeguarding lives and trust.

---

##  Final Thought

The categorization of OpenMRS is now **officially recorded** in the System Security Plan and organizational inventory.  
We move forward knowing that our risk assessment is not only thoughtful, but backed by leadership.

Tomorrow, we enter the **Select phase** — and I’m ready to build a defense tailored to our risk.
