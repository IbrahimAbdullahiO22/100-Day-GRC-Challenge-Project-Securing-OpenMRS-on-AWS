# Day 58 – Plan the Attack (Plan the Assessment, That Is!)

Welcome to Day 58 of my 100 Days of GRC journey. After building and documenting controls for OpenMRS on AWS, it’s time to step into the **Assess** phase of the NIST RMF. Today’s focus is **Task A-2: Develop the Assessment Plan** — the roadmap that guides how our security controls will be evaluated.

---

##  Objectives for the Day

- Understand the purpose and importance of an Assessment Plan.
- Learn what goes into the plan: scope, schedule, roles, methods, and boundaries.
- Apply NIST SP 800-53A methods — **Examine**, **Interview**, **Test** — in designing my approach.
- Draft a sample plan tailored to my OpenMRS on AWS deployment.

## � What Is an Assessment Plan?

An **Assessment Plan** is a formal document that outlines **what will be tested, how it will be tested, who will test it, and when**. It removes guesswork and ensures transparency and alignment between the assessor and system owner.

The purpose isn’t just formality — it sets the tone for the engagement, protects the system from unintentional disruptions, and ensures the assessor’s efforts focus on **what matters most**.

## � What Goes Into a Solid Assessment Plan?

### 🔍 Scope

> Defines what’s in and out of bounds.

- In-Scope: OpenMRS web application, AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, S3), IAM roles, backups, encryption.
- Out-of-Scope: Physical facility controls, local clinic LAN devices.

###  Assessment Team & Roles

| Name         | Role                          |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Jane Doe     | Lead Assessor (External SME)  |
| Bob Smith    | System Owner (Clinic IT Lead) |
| Alice Wang   | AWS Engineer (Support)        |

---

###  Schedule and Logistics

| Date       | Activity                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Oct 5      | Assessor off-site document review             |
| Oct 8      | Interviews (OpenMRS Admin, Clinic Physician)  |
| Oct 9      | Technical testing of AWS setup (staging only) |
| Oct 12     | Preliminary results and findings discussion   |

**Logistics Notes:**

- Read-only IAM credentials provisioned for Jane.
- Non-production OpenMRS staging account for safe testing.
- Interviews scheduled outside clinic busy hours.

###  Assessment Methods by Control

Below are selected examples using the **Examine / Interview / Test** methods from NIST 800-53A:

#### **AC-2 – Account Management**

- **Examine**: Review OpenMRS user list, AWS IAM users/roles, audit logs.
- **Interview**: Ask Bob how onboarding/offboarding happens.
- **Test**: Try logging in with a disabled OpenMRS account (test user).

#### **CM-2 – Configuration Baseline**

- **Examine**: Check baseline docs, compare with actual patch levels.
- **Interview**: Speak with Alice about patch tracking and documentation.
- **Test**: Validate installed packages on EC2 (read-only commands).

#### **SI-2 – Malware Defense**

- **Examine**: Review deployment of AWS Inspector or antivirus software.
- **Interview**: Ask about update frequency and scan cadence.
- **Test**: Drop EICAR test file in a secure environment to verify detection.

---

### ⚖ Rules of Engagement

- **No testing on production** unless explicitly approved.
- **No exploitation** of vulnerabilities — only discovery and reporting.
- **Read-only scans only**, staged in test environment.
- All activities are **pre-coordinated** — no surprise testing.

---

###  Reporting & Sign-Off

- Assessor will deliver report by **Oct 15**.
- Report includes: Executive summary, control-by-control findings, risk ratings, and actionable remediation guidance.
- Plan to be signed by system owner and reviewed by governance lead or CISO.

##  Hands-On Exercise – My Planning Snapshot

###  Controls I Want Assessed

- **User Access & Permissions** – AC-2
- **Data Encryption (At Rest & In Transit)** – SC-12 / SC-13
- **Audit Logging & Monitoring** – AU-2 / AU-6
- **Backup & Recovery** – CP-9 / CP-10
- **Web App Security (OWASP Alignment)** – SI-10

###  Methods

| Control                      | Methods                      |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| User Access & Permissions   | Examine, Interview, Test     |
| Data Encryption             | Examine                      |
| Audit Logging               | Examine, Interview           |
| Backup & Recovery           | Interview, Examine           |
| Web App Security            | Test (Staging Only), Examine |

###  Logistics Prep

- Provision test user accounts.
- Ensure CloudTrail logs and backup configs are accessible.
- Schedule 30-minute Q&A with OpenMRS users and AWS engineer.

###� Mini Timeline

- **Day 1**: Kickoff, interviews, documentation review.
- **Day 2**: Technical testing on AWS and OpenMRS (in staging).
- **Day 3**: Debrief and review preliminary report.

##  Reflection

Writing the plan made me feel more **in control** of the process. Instead of worrying about “what the assessor might look for,” I now feel prepared and organized. This planning step showed me the **value of structure in security governance**. I especially appreciated aligning my control tests with the **Examine/Interview/Test** framework — it adds rigor and clarity.

I also realized the value of **rules of engagement**. It protects both the system and the assessor. Just like a good contract, boundaries create confidence.

## 🔭 What’s Next?

Tomorrow is Day 59 — **Assessment Execution**. I’ll walk through how we actually carry out this plan, from interviews to evidence collection, and what it’s like to experience a real control assessment.
