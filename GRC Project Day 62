# Day 62: Task A-5 – Remediation Actions

Welcome to **Day 62** of my 100 Days of GRC journey.  
Today marked a pivotal shift: from identifying security weaknesses to actively fixing them. We’ve completed our Security Assessment Report (SAR) for the OpenMRS-on-AWS environment, and now we engage in the real-world discipline of **remediation** — addressing those findings, reducing risk, and moving our system closer to Authorization to Operate (ATO).

---

##  Today’s Learning Objectives

- **Prioritize and plan remediation efforts** for technical and process-based vulnerabilities.
- **Execute and document corrective actions** such as patching, configuration hardening, or procedural improvements.
- **Maintain communication with stakeholders** (e.g., the Authorizing Official) about progress and ongoing efforts.

##  From Findings to Fixes – Where to Begin?

Security assessments often leave us with a long list of findings — but not all risks are created equal.

I’ve learned to follow a **risk-based prioritization model**, where:
- **High-risk** issues are fixed immediately.
- **Moderate-risk** issues are planned and mitigated soon after.
- **Low-risk** findings are tracked and scheduled with flexibility.

For example, in the OpenMRS case, suppose the SAR revealed:
- A **weak password policy** (High risk).
- An **unpatched Tomcat vulnerability** (High risk).
- **Missing training documentation** (Moderate risk).
- **S3 bucket without default encryption** (Moderate risk).

We start with the two high-risk findings — these pose unacceptable exposure and must be addressed before ATO.

##  Executing Remediation Actions

Here’s how I tackled real-world remediation steps:

###  1. **Patching Vulnerabilities**

**Finding:** Outdated Tomcat version running OpenMRS.  
**Action:** Scheduled a maintenance window, updated Tomcat to the latest secure release, and re-ran vulnerability scans using Amazon Inspector and Nessus.  
**Outcome:** The patched system passed all critical checks.  
**Control Remediated:** `SI-2 – Flaw Remediation`  
**Lesson:** Patching is low-hanging fruit with high impact — but must be coupled with re-testing.

---

###  2. **Strengthening Password and IAM Policies**

**Finding:** OpenMRS app and AWS IAM had weak password requirements.  
**Action:**  
- Enforced a new password policy (12+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) within OpenMRS.  
- Updated AWS IAM to require strong password complexity and enabled MFA for admin accounts.  
**Outcome:** User accounts now comply with NIST SP 800-53 `IA-5` guidance.  
**Lesson:** IAM controls are often overlooked but are central to protecting cloud workloads.

---

###  3. **Fixing Configuration Weaknesses**

**Finding:** RDS snapshots and S3 backup buckets were unencrypted.  
**Action:**  
- Enabled default encryption on S3.  
- Re-created RDS snapshots with KMS-managed encryption.  
**Outcome:** All data-at-rest is now encrypted by default.  
**Control Remediated:** `SC-12/SC-13 – Cryptographic Protection`  
**Lesson:** AWS makes secure defaults easy — it’s on us to enforce them.

---

###  4. **Process and Procedure Enhancements**

**Finding:** No evidence of routine log reviews or user access recertifications.  
**Action:**  
- Drafted and implemented a **monthly CloudTrail review SOP**.  
- Assigned log review responsibilities to a designated analyst.  
- Scheduled quarterly user access reviews across OpenMRS and AWS IAM.  
**Evidence Collected:** Log review checklist, first audit report, access review records.  
**Lesson:** GRC is as much about **discipline** as it is about tools.

---

##  Keeping the AO and Team Informed

Communication is not optional — it’s essential.

I prepared a **remediation status memo** for the Authorizing Official (AO) that included:
- Total number of findings by risk level.
- Number of items remediated to date.
- Timeline for completing the remaining actions.
- Evidence of fixes (screenshots, scan results, audit reports).

This level of transparency fosters trust and keeps everyone aligned.

### Example AO Update Summary:

## ✍ Mini Exercise (Real-World Example)

> **04/25/2025 – Enabled encryption on OpenMRS S3 backup bucket via AWS Console.  
> Verified via Trusted Advisor and AWS Config compliance reports.  
> Control SC-12 marked as satisfied post-fix.**

This kind of clear, timestamped remediation note is what we provide during reassessments and as part of the final ATO package.

##  Reflection

Today reinforced that **security is a living process**. A good SAR means little without action. Fixing issues — whether it’s a CLI command, AWS Console change, or stakeholder meeting — is where we **move the needle**.

I also realized that:
- Fixes are easier when controls were well-defined to begin with.
- Collaboration across IT, GRC, and engineering is essential.
- Every small fix builds toward a stronger security posture and safer system.

##  Tomorrow’s Focus: Day 63 – POA&M (Plan of Action and Milestones)

While we’ve remediated high-priority issues, some moderate and low-risk findings may still remain. On **Day 63**, I’ll create a formal **POA&M** to track remaining risks, assign owners, and establish due dates. It’s the bridge from assessment to long-term governance.

Stay tuned — we’re almost through the Assess phase!
