#  Day 75 – System Disposal (Secure Decommissioning)

Even the most mission-critical systems must eventually sunset. Today, on **Day 75** of my 100 Days of GRC, we focus on **Task R-1: System Disposal** — the secure, complete decommissioning of a system like **OpenMRS running on AWS**.

Whether due to a system upgrade, project termination, or modernization effort, system disposal is **not just about pulling the plug** — it’s about ensuring no sensitive data is left behind, no residual risks remain, and all documentation reflects the system’s retirement.

##  Why Disposal Matters

Failing to securely decommission systems can lead to:

- **Data breaches from residual storage**
- **Unauthorized access to “forgotten” infrastructure**
- **Audit findings for poor lifecycle management**

Disposal is the final chapter in the RMF lifecycle — and it must be written with the same discipline and care as system authorization.

##  Key Steps for Secure Decommissioning

Here’s how I would approach shutting down the OpenMRS-on-AWS system:

###  1. Archive Required Data
- **Export and encrypt** critical patient records.
- Store in **long-term secure cloud storage** (e.g., Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive).
- Retention aligns with **HIPAA** or applicable compliance standards.

###  2. Sanitize All Sensitive Data
Apply **NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1** media sanitization principles:

- **Purge EC2 volumes and RDS instances** using built-in AWS secure deletion tools.
- **Permanently delete S3 buckets** (and all object versions and delete markers).
- **Destroy encryption keys** used for data-at-rest to render residual storage unreadable.
- **Remove CloudWatch logs**, Lambda archives, and related backups that contain PHI or sensitive information.

###  3. Decommission Infrastructure
- Terminate AWS resources (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM policies specific to OpenMRS).
- Delete Route53 records and domain names linked to the system.
- Remove the system from **asset inventories**, dashboards, and monitoring tools.

###  4. Update Documentation
- Annotate the **System Security Plan** to reflect retirement.
- Close all remaining **POA&M** items or transfer them to lessons-learned documentation.
- Document steps in a **Disposal Report** for audit trail and ATO closure.

###  5. Revoke Access
- Deactivate all OpenMRS admin and user accounts.
- Revoke IAM roles, VPN profiles, and third-party integrations.
- Remove OpenMRS from **authentication directories and federated access systems**.

##  Disposal Checklist (Sample Items)

- ✔️ Archive encrypted database backup in Glacier Vault (retention: 7 years)
- ✔️ Delete all S3 buckets used for OpenMRS image uploads and verify object removal
- ✔️ Terminate EC2 instances and confirm volume deletion via AWS console
- ✔️ Shred any on-prem hardware backups or laptops storing PHI (if applicable)
- ✔️ Revoke all OpenMRS-related IAM roles and document access log closure
- ✔️ Update SSP and asset inventory to reflect system retirement date

##  Reflection

Deleting a file doesn’t mean it’s gone. In cloud environments, **versioning, backups, shadow copies**, and **metadata caches** can all hold sensitive remnants. That’s why we don’t just “delete” — we **sanitize**.

The real challenge is balancing:

- **Data retention** (e.g., for HIPAA or legal compliance)
- **Data destruction** (e.g., to avoid residual risk)

Using cloud-native tools alongside frameworks like **NIST SP 800-88** gives us confidence that once data is deleted — it’s **gone for good**.

##  Today’s Goal

Understand the **full lifecycle closure** of a system — not just turning it off, but decommissioning securely, documenting actions, and validating data sanitization.

##  Up Next: Day 76 – Writing Security Policies that Actually Work

We’ve retired OpenMRS safely — now it’s time to explore the foundation of every GRC program: **security policies**. Tomorrow, I’ll break down how to craft policies that are clear, enforceable, and actually followed. No more doorstops — we’re writing for impact.
