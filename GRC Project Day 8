# 📅 Day 8 – PCI DSS (Keeping Credit Card Data Safe) and What It Teaches Us | 100 Days of GRC  
_By Ibrahim Abdullahi_

##  My Leadership Perspective

Today, I shifted my focus from healthcare to payment security — exploring **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).**  

You may wonder: *“What does credit card data protection have to do with healthcare systems like OpenMRS?”* 

> **The answer:** The foundational security principles behind PCI DSS apply to any system that handles **sensitive data** — whether that’s cardholder data (CHD) or protected health information (PHI).  

As GRC professionals, it is our role to **draw lessons from every industry** and apply them where they fit — and PCI DSS offers excellent, actionable controls that healthcare IT systems can benefit from.

##  What I’ve Learned: PCI DSS Overview

**PCI DSS** is an industry standard (not a law) that defines mandatory security controls for **any organization processing or storing cardholder data**. It was developed by major credit card companies (Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, etc.) to reduce card data breaches.  

Even though PCI DSS focuses on financial data, **many of its 12 core requirements overlap with security best practices** in healthcare — encryption, access control, vulnerability management, monitoring, and governance.  

I see PCI DSS as a **very prescriptive framework** — much more “checklist-driven” than something like ISO 27001. And sometimes that’s what organizations need — especially smaller ones. Clear, non-ambiguous requirements help drive accountability.

##  PCI DSS 12 Core Requirements (Lessons I’d Apply to OpenMRS)  

| PCI DSS Objective | What It Means | How It Applies to OpenMRS / Healthcare |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Build & Maintain a Secure Network | Use firewalls and change default settings | Harden OpenMRS servers, configure proper firewalls (AWS Security Groups, WAF) |
| Protect Cardholder Data | Encrypt card data in transit & at rest | Encrypt PHI in OpenMRS DB & enforce HTTPS |
| Maintain a Vulnerability Management Program | Patch systems and protect from malware | Apply patches and endpoint protections on OpenMRS servers and clients |
| Implement Strong Access Controls | Enforce least privilege, unique accounts, physical security | Role-based access in OpenMRS, MFA, secure workstation access |
| Regularly Monitor & Test Networks | Log all access, perform regular tests | Implement OpenMRS audit logging, run vulnerability scans/pen tests |
| Maintain Security Policies | Have documented policies and training | Healthcare orgs should have formal PHI security policies & HIPAA-required training |

##  My Hands-On Takeaway: One PCI DSS Requirement for OpenMRS

If I had to adopt **one PCI DSS control into an OpenMRS healthcare implementation**, it would be:  

 **Requirement 10 – Regularly Monitor and Test Networks**  
*“Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data.”*

**Why?** In healthcare, auditing access to PHI is critical — not only for detecting malicious access, but also for satisfying HIPAA’s required audit controls (164.312(b)).  

An OpenMRS system **must log who accessed what patient records, when, and from where** — and those logs must be reviewed regularly. The principle here is universal: **“You can’t protect what you don’t monitor.”**

##  Teaching Insight: Prescriptive vs Flexible Standards

After studying PCI DSS today, here’s my takeaway:  

- Some industries (payments) benefit from strict prescriptive rules — PCI DSS is very explicit, and it works well for driving adoption.  
- Others (like healthcare) use more flexible “risk-based” frameworks (like HIPAA, NIST RMF, ISO 27001).  

**As a leader, I believe BOTH approaches have value**:  

- Prescriptive standards reduce ambiguity for smaller or less mature organizations.  
- Flexible, risk-based frameworks encourage continuous improvement for mature orgs.  

In my experience, **a hybrid is ideal**: Start with prescriptive basics, then evolve toward a mature, contextual security program.

##  Reflection

Would it be helpful or burdensome to apply PCI-style strict requirements to OpenMRS?  
Personally, I believe many healthcare orgs *would benefit* from more explicit security checklists — especially those new to HIPAA or without strong internal security maturity.  

> “Compliance isn’t security — but it can drive foundational improvements.”  

And I would advocate for applying **PCI DSS-like rigor** to critical healthcare systems — because at the end of the day: **PHI is just as sensitive — if not more — than payment data.**

##  Tomorrow’s Focus

Next, I’ll be exploring **ISO/IEC 27001 — the gold standard for building an Information Security Management System (ISMS).**  

I’m looking forward to comparing ISO 27001 with PCI DSS — one is very process-oriented, the other is a strong prescriptive checklist. **Different tools — both valuable.** Stay tuned for Day 9!
