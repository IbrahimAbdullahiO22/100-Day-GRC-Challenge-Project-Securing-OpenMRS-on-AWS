#  Day 64: Task R-1 – Assemble Authorization Package

Welcome to Day 64!  After weeks of securing and assessing OpenMRS on AWS, today I took a big step forward in the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): **assembling the Authorization Package**. This is the formal bundle of documents we submit to the Authorizing Official (AO) for a risk-based decision on whether the system is secure enough to operate.

##  Why This Step Matters

Think of the Authorization Package as the **final report card** for the system. It consolidates all our security efforts—designs, assessments, fixes, and risk decisions—into one cohesive package. It's also where leadership gets to see the big picture.

As a GRC practitioner working toward a future in healthcare compliance, this step is key for showing I can **communicate risk clearly**, **document thoroughly**, and **lead through assurance**.

##  Key Components of the Authorization Package

###  1. System Security Plan (SSP)
This contains:
- Overview of OpenMRS on AWS: system purpose, boundaries, and environment
- The full list of implemented NIST SP 800-53 controls
- AWS architectural diagrams
- Encryption protocols, IAM, backup strategies, etc.

 *Status:* Finalized and reviewed for consistency. Encryption and IAM sections double-checked for accuracy.

---

###  2. Security Assessment Report (SAR)
Summarizes:
- Which controls were assessed (e.g., AC-2, SI-2, SC-13)
- Methods used: Interviews, testing, documentation review
- Results: 100 controls tested, 5 moderate-risk findings, 0 high-risk
- Control-by-control evidence of effectiveness

 *Status:* Complete. Assessment results verified, including screenshots and logs as supporting evidence.

---

###  3. Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)
Outlines:
- Outstanding issues and their risk ratings
- Remediation plans, responsible parties, and deadlines
- Example: Weak MFA on admin accounts (moderate) – due 05/15/2025
- Demonstrates that unresolved risks are being actively managed

 *Status:* Living document. All high-risk items mitigated; moderate/low items are scheduled with owners assigned.

---

###  4. Executive Summary
This one-pager delivers the strategic narrative:
> *"OpenMRS is an open-source EHR system deployed on AWS to support multiple healthcare clinics. It underwent full NIST SP 800-53A assessment with zero high-risk findings. All moderate findings are documented and under remediation. The system's risk posture is considered acceptable for operation with ongoing monitoring in place."*

 *Status:* Complete. Reviewed for alignment with SAR and POA&M.

##  Leadership Lessons Learned

Assembling the package forced me to:
- **Think holistically** about risk—not just control-by-control
- **Ensure documentation integrity**—what’s in the SSP must align with SAR and POA&M
- **Summarize complexity** for executive audiences
- **Own accountability** as a system steward

I also saw how powerful well-documented evidence can be in building trust. When an AO sees a clean, coherent package, they gain confidence in the team behind the system.

##  Hands-On Checklist

Here’s a quick self-check I used before finalizing:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| System Security Plan | ✅ Finalized | Includes AWS architecture, IAM, encryption |
| Security Assessment Report | ✅ Complete | 100 controls tested, findings clearly documented |
| POA&M | ✅ Updated | 3 open moderate issues with dates & owners |
| Executive Summary | ✅ Done | Matches SAR & SSP; reviewed for clarity |

##  Reflection

Gathering all this evidence felt like both a celebration and an audit of my own discipline. Every weak spot in documentation exposed a possible gap in process. I learned that **security isn’t just about technical controls—it’s about traceability, accountability, and communication**.

This also reinforced a mantra I’ve started adopting:
> *“If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.”*

Clear documentation isn’t just compliance—it’s leadership in action.

##  Search Terms I Used

- “NIST RMF Authorization Package contents”
- “FedRAMP ATO checklist”
- “Security Assessment Report vs POA&M”
- “HIPAA ATO documentation healthcare”
- “How to write an executive summary for system security”

##  What’s Next?

Next is Task R-2: Review Authorization Package and make the risk-based decision. I’ll step into the AO’s mindset and assess whether the system is ready for Authorization to Operate (ATO). It’s where assurance meets executive judgment.

Thanks for following along on Day 64. This stage taught me the art of **closing the loop** in security work. If you’re building in GRC or healthcare cybersecurity, make documentation your ally and your leadership tool.

Stay tuned for Day 65!
