# 📅 Day 3 – Risk Management: Understanding Threats and Impact | 100 Days of GRC

##  What I’ve Learned About Risk Management

Today’s journey into the “R” of GRC reminded me how critical it is for every security leader to develop a **risk mindset** — not just focusing on controls, but thinking about **what could go wrong**, **how bad it would be**, and **how likely it is to happen**.

At its core:

 A **threat** is something bad that could happen (e.g., hackers, insider misuse, outages).  
 A **vulnerability** is a weakness that could be exploited (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords).  
 A **risk** is when a threat meets a vulnerability — and we assess it as:  

**Risk = Likelihood × Impact**

##  Applying This to Healthcare — and OpenMRS

In a healthcare context, this becomes very real:

- Threat: Ransomware attack  
- Vulnerability: Outdated OpenMRS server  
- Risk: Attackers encrypt ePHI, halt operations, trigger HIPAA fines — very high likelihood and very high impact.

Healthcare is one of the most targeted industries — because patient data is valuable, and downtime can be life-threatening.

For an OpenMRS deployment on AWS, the risks I would actively track include:

1️⃣ **Data Breach (Confidentiality risk):** If OpenMRS is breached, PHI could be exposed — with direct patient harm and regulatory penalties.  
2️⃣ **Integrity Compromise:** If medical records are altered (maliciously or accidentally), patient safety is at stake.  
3️⃣ **Availability Outage:** If OpenMRS is down (due to ransomware or cloud misconfiguration), care delivery is disrupted.

##  Teaching Point for My Team

> **Risk management isn’t about avoiding all risk (impossible). It’s about knowing which risks matter most, and managing them intelligently.**

As a GRC leader, I focus my team on **prioritizing**:

 Address HIGH likelihood + HIGH impact risks first (like ransomware + outdated software).  
 Monitor and mitigate MEDIUM risks.  
 Document LOW risks and revisit as needed.

##  My Personal Reflection

In my career, I’ve seen how **underestimating impact** can lead to disaster.

Example: At a former organization, leadership dismissed a known vulnerability as “low risk” because “no one would attack us.” Six months later, the system was breached — leading to public embarrassment and a costly recovery.

Lesson learned:

**Always respect the “what if” — and validate assumptions with reality.**

##  Real-World Exercise: Mini Risk Brainstorm for OpenMRS

**Threat:** Ransomware attack  
**Vulnerability:** Unpatched Tomcat server running OpenMRS  
**Likelihood:** HIGH  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Risk Priority:** Critical — must address with patching, EDR, and backups.

**Threat:** Insider accidental disclosure (emailing PHI to wrong party)  
**Vulnerability:** Lack of user awareness training  
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Risk Priority:** High — requires training and DLP controls.

## Final Thought

Without structured risk management, an organization is **flying blind**. But with it, we can steer proactively — reducing surprises, protecting patients, and building trust.

That’s why **R** is such an important pillar of GRC.

## What’s Next?

Tomorrow — onto **Compliance (C)**: understanding how compliance works alongside (but is not a substitute for) real security. I’m looking forward to diving deeper into HIPAA and other healthcare frameworks. Onward!
