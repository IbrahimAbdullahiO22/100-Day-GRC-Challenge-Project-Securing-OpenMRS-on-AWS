# Day 63: Task A-6 – Prepare POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)

Welcome to **Day 63** of my GRC journey. Today, I dove deep into one of the most critical components of the RMF process: the **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)**. After conducting control assessments and documenting findings in the Security Assessment Report (SAR), the POA&M becomes our action blueprint. It's where strategy meets execution.

##  What I Learned

###  What is a POA&M?
A **Plan of Action and Milestones** is a living document that:

- Tracks **unresolved security weaknesses**.
- Lays out **remediation steps**, **responsible parties**, and **target dates**.
- Provides the Authorizing Official (AO) with confidence that issues are acknowledged and being addressed.

> Think of it as a formal, auditable to-do list for risk mitigation. It brings visibility, accountability, and structure to remediation.

##  Key Components of a POA&M

| Field                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **POA&M ID**             | Unique identifier for tracking the finding                                  |
| **Weakness**             | Brief summary of the issue                                                  |
| **Control Reference**    | NIST 800-53 control or requirement associated with the issue                |
| **Description**          | Detailed explanation of the vulnerability or deficiency                     |
| **Risk Level**           | High / Moderate / Low                                                       |
| **Point of Contact**     | Individual or team responsible for remediation                              |
| **Planned Actions**      | Milestones outlining the fix strategy                                       |
| **Target Completion Date** | Deadline for final resolution                                               |
| **Status**               | Open, In Progress, Completed, Delayed, etc.                                |
| **Comments**             | Any notes on progress, dependencies, or delays                             |

##  Sample POA&M Entries from My OpenMRS Case Study

###  **POA&M ID: 63-1**

- **Weakness:** Default admin account in OpenMRS not disabled (potential brute-force target)
- **Control Reference:** AC-2 (Account Management) / IA-5 (Authenticator Management)
- **Description:** The default admin account ("admin") was found active with a weak password.
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Point of Contact:** John Doe, Lead DevOps Engineer
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Milestone 1: Change default password to a complex one ✅ (Completed 07/06/2025)
  - Milestone 2: Create a new admin account & disable the default account (Target: 04/27/2025)
  - Milestone 3: Update documentation/scripts to remove default account dependencies (Target: 05/04/2025)
- **Target Completion Date:** 05/04/2025
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Comments:** Waiting on vendor confirmation to fully remove the account. All other steps completed.

###  **POA&M ID: 63-2**

- **Weakness:** Missing encryption on OpenMRS database backups (RDS snapshots)
- **Control Reference:** SC-12 (Cryptographic Key Establishment)
- **Risk Level:** Moderate
- **Point of Contact:** Jane Smith, Cloud Architect
- **Planned Actions:**
  - Enable encryption for existing and future RDS snapshots
  - Implement policy for default encryption of all AWS backups
- **Target Completion Date:** 05/15/2025
- **Status:** Open
- **Comments:** Requires snapshot replacement and validation. Scheduled for next maintenance window.

##  Why POA&M Matters

- **Shows ownership:** Everyone knows who’s responsible for what.
- **Enables prioritization:** Focuses remediation efforts based on risk level.
- **Drives accountability:** Regular updates force transparency and momentum.
- **Supports ATO:** The AO relies on the POA&M as a key decision-making tool.

> "What gets measured, gets managed." The POA&M ensures lingering security issues don't fall through the cracks.

##  Hands-On Reflection
Today I drafted a mini POA&M for two OpenMRS findings. This forced me to:
- Evaluate real risk levels
- Set achievable target dates
- Break remediation into clear milestones

I now understand that maintaining an accurate and living POA&M is not just good practice — it's essential for continuous monitoring and compliance.
