#  Day 68: Task R-5 ‚Äì Authorization Reporting

Welcome to **Day 68** of my 100-Day GRC journey!  

After the excitement of receiving the **Authorization to Operate (ATO)**, you might be tempted to close the book ‚Äî but **we‚Äôre not done just yet**. One final task remains in the Authorize step of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF): **Authorization Reporting**.

This is where we **document and communicate** the ATO decision across the organization, making sure everyone who needs to know‚Ä¶ does. It‚Äôs about transparency, accountability, and laying the foundation for continuous monitoring.

##  What Is Task R-5?

**Authorization Reporting** ensures that the AO‚Äôs decision ‚Äî and any residual risks ‚Äî are properly recorded and disseminated. It helps align the organization‚Äôs understanding of the system‚Äôs current security posture and sets expectations for future oversight.

Here‚Äôs what this step typically includes:

---

###  1. Notify Key Organizational Officials

The **Authorizing Official (AO)** or their delegate must inform relevant stakeholders of the authorization outcome. This often includes:

- CIO  
- CISO  
- System Owner  
- Risk Executive  
- IT Governance Board

**Why it matters**: Reporting the ATO and any **outstanding vulnerabilities** ensures system-level risks are understood in the broader context of enterprise risk.

**Example:**  
> "OpenMRS has been granted ATO as of April 1, 2025. No high risks remain. Two moderate risks ‚Äî MFA implementation and API rate limiting ‚Äî are being addressed within 60 days."

---

###  2. Update the System Registry

Every organization should maintain an **inventory of systems** ‚Äî often housed in a GRC tool or internal registry. This registry should be updated with:

- Authorization Date  
- Expiration Date  
- Authorizing Official  
- Residual Risks  
- Associated POA&M Items  

For example:  
> **System**: OpenMRS  
> **ATO Granted**: Apr 1, 2025  
> **Expires**: Apr 1, 2028  
> **AO**: Dr. Tran  
> **Residual Risk**: Moderate ‚Äì MFA & rate limiting in progress

---

###  3. Record Accepted Risks and Conditions

If **moderate or high risks** were accepted, they should be clearly documented and visible to senior leadership. Some organizations maintain a **central risk dashboard** to provide real-time insights into residual risk across all systems.

In our case:  
- **No high risks**  
- **Two moderate risks**, accepted with mitigation underway  
- Conditions noted in the ATO letter and the POA&M

---

###  4. Archive the Authorization Package

Although not explicitly highlighted in NIST‚Äôs step, it‚Äôs best practice to **archive the full authorization package** in a secure document repository.

This includes:

- Signed ATO Letter  
- Final System Security Plan (SSP)  
- Security Assessment Report (SAR)  
- Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)  

**Why?**  
To support compliance, future audits, and ensure continuity if personnel change. Organizational knowledge must live beyond the inbox.

##  Real-World Example ‚Äì OpenMRS on AWS

After Dr. Tran signed the ATO, the **Information Security Office** initiated the reporting process:

###  Email Notification:
> "**Subject**: ATO Granted for OpenMRS Health Records System  
> **Date**: April 1, 2025  
>  
> The OpenMRS EHR system has been granted an Authorization to Operate (ATO) valid through April 1, 2028.  
>  
> Conditions:  
> - MFA for admin accounts to be implemented before May 31, 2025  
> - API rate limiting to be deployed by June 30, 2025  
>  
> No high-severity risks remain. Moderate risks have been accepted and are being mitigated.  
>  
> Congratulations to the team for their dedication and commitment to security compliance."

###  Registry Update:
The security analyst updated the internal ATO tracker:
- Status: **Authorized**  
- Start Date: **April 1, 2025**  
- Expiration: **April 1, 2028**  
- Outstanding POA&M Items: MFA & API security  
- AO: **Dr. Tran**

Reminders were also scheduled for:
- **60-day risk mitigation follow-up**  
- **3-month pre-expiration reauthorization planning**

##  Why Reporting Matters

Authorization Reporting promotes **institutional memory**, **visibility**, and **accountability**.

-  **Risk Transparency**: Everyone knows what risks exist and who accepted them  
-  **Smooth Handoffs**: Critical for continuity across system owners, security staff, and leadership  
-  **Strategic Oversight**: Supports enterprise risk dashboards and FISMA/NIST reporting  
-  **GRC Alignment**: Ensures ATO status is current and traceable in all official records

Without reporting, the risk decision could live in a silo ‚Äî but RMF is a **team sport**, and everyone needs to be aligned.

---

##  Hands-On Exercise

Create a simple ATO summary for a fictional system:

> **System**: XYZ Payroll System  
> **Owner**: Finance IT  
> **ATO Granted**: Aug 1, 2025  
> **Expires**: Aug 1, 2028  
> **Conditions**: PII encryption for backup files within 30 days  
> **Residual Risk**: 1 moderate ‚Äì Accepted

This reinforces what matters most in reporting: who owns the system, what the AO decided, and what risk remains.

---

##  Reflection

Reflect on the **importance of making authorization decisions visible**:

- How does this support organizational trust and preparedness?
- If a breach occurred tomorrow, would responders know when the last ATO was granted and what risks were accepted?
- How does this reporting process reinforce the seriousness of the AO's decision?

**For me, this reinforces that leadership in GRC is not just about compliance ‚Äî it's about stewardship, communication, and risk-informed decision-making.**

##  Teaser for Day 69 ‚Äì Monitoring Begins

Now that OpenMRS is authorized, our job shifts from building to **operating securely**. Tomorrow, in Day 69, we enter the final step of the RMF: **Monitor**.  

This is where we ensure our controls remain effective, respond to new threats, and uphold the integrity of the system over time. Let‚Äôs keep going ‚Äî the finish line is near! üèÅ
