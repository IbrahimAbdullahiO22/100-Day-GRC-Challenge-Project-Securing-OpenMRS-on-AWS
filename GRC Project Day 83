# Day 83 â€“ Measuring GRC with KPIs & KRIs | 100 Days of GRC

Today, I dove deep into one of the most crucial yet often overlooked elements of a mature GRC program â€” **measurement**. You canâ€™t improve what you donâ€™t measure, and in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), metrics provide the visibility needed to prove effectiveness and uncover emerging threats. Two powerful tools in this space are **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)**.

## What I Learned

###  KPIs = Measuring Performance  
KPIs help track how well processes are functioning against expectations or goals. Theyâ€™re aligned with continuous improvement and compliance success.

###  KRIs = Monitoring Risk  
KRIs are early warning signals that highlight increasing exposure to risk. They help GRC leaders stay proactive instead of reactive.

## Applying KPIs & KRIs to OpenMRS on AWS

As I manage the OpenMRS deployment on AWS from a GRC perspective, I started thinking about what metrics truly reflect both performance and potential risk. Below are some contextualized examples Iâ€™ve mapped out:

### Patch Management  
- **KPI**: `% of critical patches applied within 30 days of release`  
   â†’ Measures efficiency of patch management and responsiveness.
- **KRI**: `Number of high-risk vulnerabilities unpatched >30 days`  
   â†’ Indicates build-up of security debt, increasing breach risk.

### User Access Governance  
- **KPI**: `% of monthly user access reviews completed on time`  
   â†’ Tracks adherence to access governance policy.
- **KRI**: `Number of stale/inactive OpenMRS accounts >90 days`  
   â†’ Identifies potential risks from unused but active accounts.

###  Security Awareness  
- **KPI**: `% of workforce who completed mandatory training this quarter`  
   â†’ Reflects commitment to staff education and compliance.
- **KRI**: `Number of employees overdue on cybersecurity training`  
   â†’ Signals cultural and human-layer vulnerabilities.

###  Incident Response & Resilience  
- **KPI**: `Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) from OpenMRS outages`  
   â†’ Demonstrates recovery efficiency after incidents.
- **KRI**: `Downtime hours due to security incidents`  
   â†’ Reflects risk to availability and operational continuity.

## Hands-On Metrics Iâ€™ve Defined

For my OpenMRS GRC Program, here are two key metrics Iâ€™ve chosen to implement and track:

###  KPI:
**Percentage of monthly OpenMRS data backups completed successfully**
- **Why it matters**: Ensures critical patient data is protected and recoverable.
- **How Iâ€™ll measure**: Automate reporting from backup logs via scheduled scripts that verify timestamps and status codes of completed backup jobs.

###  KRI:
**Number of critical vulnerabilities on OpenMRS server older than 30 days**
- **Why it matters**: Highlights unresolved high-risk exposures that could lead to compromise.
- **How Iâ€™ll measure**: Use Nessus scan reports and internal ticket logs to track open findings past due remediation timelines.

##  Reflection

At this stage in my GRC journey, **KRIs are more valuable for me** than KPIs. While KPIs help validate that my processes are running smoothly, **KRIs help me detect lurking risks before they become incidents**. As I focus on strengthening OpenMRSâ€™s security posture, the ability to see risk trends in real-time is key.

This doesnâ€™t mean I ignore KPIs â€” theyâ€™re crucial for reporting and stakeholder assurance â€” but in my current environment, **risk detection is the immediate priority**. Moving forward, I plan to build a small dashboard that visualizes both my KPIs and KRIs, driving accountability and continuous improvement.

##  Key Takeaways

- KPIs measure how well weâ€™re doing (success).
- KRIs measure where things could go wrong (early warnings).
- Metrics need to be **specific, measurable, and tied to objectives**.
- Too many metrics create noise â€” choose what truly matters.
- Track them over time to see trends and proactively adapt your GRC strategy.

## ðŸ“£ Final Thought

By implementing KPIs and KRIs thoughtfully, Iâ€™m transforming GRC from a static checklist to a **living, breathing system of continuous feedback and control**. This is how we move from reactive to resilient. Measurement isnâ€™t just a formality â€” itâ€™s our compass in the dynamic landscape of risk and compliance.
