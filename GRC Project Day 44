# 📅 Day 44 – Task C-2: Security Categorization (FIPS 199 In Action)

##  "How Bad Could It Be?"

That’s really what **Task C-2** boils down to: understanding the potential *impact* if something goes wrong with our system.

As a leader in GRC, I’ve learned this — **you can’t design appropriate security without knowing what’s at stake.** Categorization gives us that clarity.

Today, I guided the team through applying **FIPS 199** to our OpenMRS on AWS deployment. This wasn’t just an academic exercise — it was about honestly assessing the business, legal, and human consequences if the system failed on confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

##  Case Study: OpenMRS Categorization

**How I approached it:**

- I started by reviewing the data types handled by OpenMRS — primarily **electronic protected health information (ePHI)**.
- Then I worked with clinical stakeholders to understand how clinicians use the system daily and what risks they fear most.
- Finally, I used FIPS 199 definitions to systematically rate each security objective.

###  My Analysis:

| Objective        | Impact Level | Why? |
|------------------|--------------|------|
| Confidentiality  | Moderate     | PHI exposure = serious privacy/legal harm; potential HIPAA penalties. |
| Integrity        | Moderate     | Data corruption = incorrect treatment decisions = possible patient harm. |
| Availability     | Moderate     | Downtime disrupts clinical workflows; delays patient care; forces manual fallback. |

**Overall Categorization: MODERATE (High Water Mark).**

##  Why This Matters

As GRC leaders, it’s not enough to say “secure everything.”  
**Resources are finite — so prioritization is key.**

By documenting the system as **Moderate**, I’m guiding:

 The **engineering team** — so they select controls proportional to risk.  
 The **executive team** — so they understand the business impact of outages or breaches.  
 The **audit/compliance function** — so they see how our categorization maps to required controls (HIPAA, NIST 800-53, etc.).

## 🔄 Reflection

One thing I’ve emphasized with my team is this:

> **We categorize every day — in life and in security.**  
> Just like we know losing our phone is worse than losing a pen, in cybersecurity, we must formalize this thinking.

Categorization makes priorities visible. It ensures we’re not over- or under-protecting what matters most.

In my experience, the biggest mistake organizations make is underestimating **availability**. Downtime in healthcare *isn’t just IT inconvenience — it’s clinical impact.* That’s why I was deliberate about rating OpenMRS’s availability as Moderate.

## 📝 My Practice

I also practiced this today on a personal system — my password manager vault:

- Confidentiality: High (if breached, major privacy and financial risk)
- Integrity: High (corrupted vault could lock me out of critical accounts)
- Availability: Moderate (if unavailable temporarily, inconvenient but not life-threatening)

**This helped reinforce how categorization applies at every level — personal and enterprise.**

## 🚀 What’s Next?

With categorization complete, we’re ready for review & approval (Task C-3). I’ll be presenting this impact assessment to leadership and the privacy officer next.

By doing this, I’m not just checking a box — I’m **leading the organization toward intentional, risk-informed security**.
