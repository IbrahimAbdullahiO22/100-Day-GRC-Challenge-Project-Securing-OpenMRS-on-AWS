#  Day 94: Capstone Part 8 â€“ Continuous Monitoring & Audit Readiness | 100 Days of GRC

## ï¿½ Objective

Todayâ€™s goal was to build a **Continuous Monitoring** and **Audit Readiness** strategy for our OpenMRS deployment on AWS. While weâ€™ve implemented technical controls and governance policies, security isnâ€™t a one-time job â€” itâ€™s a **living system** that needs continuous oversight.

**Continuous monitoring** ensures that security risks, control failures, and compliance gaps are detected early, while **audit readiness** ensures that we can provide clear, timely evidence of security practices and compliance activities â€” whenever required.

##  Why Continuous Monitoring & Audit Readiness Matter

-  **Threats evolve**: New vulnerabilities, phishing campaigns, or misconfigurations can appear any time.
-ï¿½ **Environments change**: Cloud resources are dynamic. Someone might open a port, change a policy, or spin up an insecure service.
-  **Audits happen**: Whether internal reviews or external HIPAA audits, you must show documentation and proof of compliance efforts.

>  Continuous monitoring ensures weâ€™re always ready â€” not just once a year.

##  Core Elements of Continuous Monitoring

### Log Reviews
- Monitor AWS CloudTrail and OpenMRS application logs
- Detect signs of misuse, privilege escalation, or data access anomalies

###  Automated Alerts
- Use AWS CloudWatch Alarms for key metrics (e.g., CPU spikes, failed logins, S3 bucket access)
- Set SNS notifications for critical events like DB restarts or security group changes

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Conduct monthly vulnerability scans on OpenMRS servers
- Use tools like Nessus or AWS Inspector to identify known CVEs

###  Compliance Checks
- Quarterly reviews of:
  - Backup success status
  - IAM user and role permissions
  - Encryption settings (RDS, S3)
  - MFA enforcement
  - Patch status of EC2 instances

###  Documentation Updates
- Keep policies, diagrams, recovery plans, and logs up-to-date
- Ensure alignment with HIPAA and NIST expectations

##  Continuous Monitoring Tools for OpenMRS on AWS

| **Tool/Service** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **AWS CloudWatch** | Monitor system health, resource utilization, and trigger alarms |
| **AWS CloudTrail** | Record AWS API activity (who did what and when) |
| **AWS Config** | Continuously assess AWS resources against compliance rules (e.g., S3 encryption) |
| **AWS Security Hub** | Aggregate alerts and posture across AWS services |
| **OpenMRS Application Logs** | Monitor user access and application-level activity |
| **Vulnerability Scanner (e.g., Nessus)** | Identify system-level weaknesses monthly |
| **Backup Testing** | Restore OpenMRS from backup quarterly to validate recovery readiness |

##  Hands-On Activity: My Monitoring Checklist

| **Monitoring Item** | **Frequency** | **Owner** | **Audit Evidence** |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Review CloudTrail logs for unusual AWS admin activity | Weekly | Security Analyst | Email summary log review report saved |
| Verify daily RDS backups completed successfully | Daily | DevOps Engineer | Backup success logs or screenshots from AWS Console |
| Run vulnerability scan on OpenMRS server | Monthly | IT Admin | Scanner report PDF stored in audit folder |
| Review OpenMRS audit log for suspicious data access | Weekly | Privacy Officer | Log review checklist signed off and stored |
| Restore a backup from S3 to test data recovery | Quarterly | DevOps | Restore report with timestamp and verification steps |
| Check IAM roles and access permissions | Quarterly | Cloud Security Engineer | IAM policy snapshot and access review form |
| Ensure S3 buckets and RDS are encrypted | Monthly | Compliance Officer | AWS Config rule evaluation reports |

>  **Pro Tip**: Each monitoring task should produce a small piece of evidence. A quick email, signed log, or PDF screenshot is enough to keep you audit-ready.

##  Reflection â€“ Monitoring = Confidence

Today was a reminder that **security isn't just about setup â€” it's about stewardship.**

Itâ€™s one thing to configure encryption or IAM roles. Itâ€™s another to ensure they **stay correct over time**, especially in the cloud where settings can drift, people can make changes, and attackers are constantly probing for weakness.

The **real power of continuous monitoring** is that it turns security into a routine â€” **no surprises, no scrambling during audits, no hoping everything works**. You *know* it does, because you're checking regularly.

Personally, I believe our **log review + backup testing** strategy is the cornerstone of this plan. Logs tell the story of whatâ€™s happening, and backup testing ensures that no matter what happens, we can recover.

>  *Takeaway*: A mature security program isnâ€™t measured by how secure your system is today â€” but how confident you are it will remain secure tomorrow.
