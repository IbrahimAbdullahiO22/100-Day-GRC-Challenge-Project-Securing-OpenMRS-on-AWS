#  Day 71: Task M-3 – Ongoing Risk Response  
**“Find it, fix it.”** That’s the mindset I’ve built throughout this GRC journey — and Day 71 is where that principle shines.  

Yesterday, I focused on detecting risks through **monitoring and assessments**. Today’s milestone, **Task M-3: Ongoing Risk Response**, is about what happens *next*: how we take action to reduce, mitigate, or formally accept the risks we discover.

##  What I’m Learning

In the world of risk management, identifying a vulnerability is only **step one**. The real value comes from **closing the loop** — taking appropriate action that prevents a small issue from snowballing into a major incident.

Risk response is not a one-time thing. It’s an ongoing discipline — a cycle of:

1. **Discovering risk**
2. **Analyzing impact**
3. **Choosing a response**
4. **Tracking it to closure**

Whether it’s a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket or a new OpenMRS vulnerability, it’s my job to **make risk response routine** and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

##  OpenMRS on AWS: What Ongoing Risk Response Looks Like

Let’s say we’re managing the **OpenMRS health records system in AWS**. Here’s how we handle new risk discoveries:

###  1. Analyze & Prioritize

- **Example**: A Nessus scan flags a **critical SQL injection** vulnerability in the OpenMRS login portal.
- **Action**: Triage the finding. Is it exploitable? What data is at risk? What’s the CVSS score?
- **Output**: Categorize it as **High Risk**, which triggers immediate attention.

---

###  2. Mitigate or Accept

- **Mitigation Path**:  
  - Apply available patch  
  - Block affected endpoints temporarily  
  - Implement a WAF rule to stop malicious input  
  - Conduct a quick test to validate the patch  
- **Acceptance Path (only for low risks)**:  
  - Document in risk register  
  - Include business rationale and interim controls  
  - Monitor closely for escalation

---

###  3. Track in POA&M Until Resolved

- **Tool**: Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)  
- **Log Entry**:  
  - Vulnerability ID  
  - Risk Level  
  - Assigned Owner  
  - Remediation Steps  
  - Target Date for Completion  
- **Example**:

##  Real-World Scenario: S3 Misconfiguration

Let’s say AWS Config flags that an **S3 bucket storing OpenMRS backups** became publicly accessible.

**Steps I’d take as a GRC Lead:**

- **Investigate**: Use CloudTrail to check who made the change and why  
- **Remediate**: Restrict bucket access immediately, apply SCP or IAM policy enforcement  
- **Mitigate**: Enable automated bucket policies and enable logging  
- **Document**: Add the incident to POA&M and follow up with training for IAM role users  

This is **continuous improvement** in action — not just fixing an issue, but preventing it from happening again.

##  Today’s Goal

Master the art of **turning findings into fixes**. Continuous monitoring is only effective when it triggers fast, intelligent, and trackable risk responses.

Ongoing risk response is where **cybersecurity meets accountability** — and where trust in the system is built.

##  Reflection

If I found a **critical vulnerability** today in OpenMRS:

1. I’d **prioritize triage** using CVSS scoring and exploitability context  
2. **Notify stakeholders**: AO, DevSecOps, system owner  
3. **Assign the issue** in our POA&M and track response  
4. Apply the **mitigation** or containment measures immediately  
5. **Schedule a reassessment** after patching to confirm it’s resolved  
6. Document the outcome and **update the SSP** if any control changed  

This response is driven by a strong **risk-aware culture** and well-documented response procedures.

##  Coming Up Next: Task M-4

In **Day 72**, I’ll move on to **Task M-4: Security Status Reporting**. It’s not just about fixing things — it’s also about communicating **how secure we are**, so stakeholders can make smart decisions with visibility and confidence.

Let’s keep building secure, auditable, and resilient systems together.
