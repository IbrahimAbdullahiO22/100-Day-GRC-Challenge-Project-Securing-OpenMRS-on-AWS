#  100-Day GRC Challenge: Securing OpenMRS on AWS

Welcome to my 100-day GRC journey.   
This project documents my structured, hands-on learning experience in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), applying real-world strategies to secure **OpenMRS**, an open-source electronic health records system, deployed on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

##  About This Project

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning portfolio, showcasing how GRC concepts are applied to cloud-based healthcare systems. Each phase builds practical experience in risk management, control implementation, policy development, and governance.

##  Journey Overview

### 🔹 Days 1–20: Lay the Foundation
- Define Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
- Identify healthcare stakeholders and HIPAA requirements
- Establish GRC scope and objectives for OpenMRS

### 🔹 Days 21–40: Master Risk Assessment
- Identify critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
- Create a risk register and assign scores
- Understand risk appetite in regulated healthcare environments

### 🔹 Days 41–60: Implement Controls & Frameworks
- Apply administrative, technical, and physical controls
- Align with NIST 800-53 and HIPAA safeguards
- Secure AWS infrastructure (IAM, S3 encryption, firewalls)

### 🔹 Days 61–80: Govern GRC Like a Pro
- Draft security policies (AUP, Data Privacy, Vendor Mgmt.)
- Establish governance, oversight, and awareness training
- Manage third-party risks using the shared responsibility model

### 🔹 Days 81–86: Capstone Prep
- Perform a GRC readiness checklist
- Align all workstreams (Continuity, Authorization, Privacy)

### 🔹 Days 87–97: Capstone Execution – Secure OpenMRS in AWS
- **Part 1–3**: Define system boundaries, risk assess, and select controls  
- **Part 4–6**: Implement controls and validate effectiveness  
- **Part 7**: Simulate risk acceptance and ATO readiness  
- **Part 8**: Create a continuous monitoring plan  
- **Part 9**: Compile a full GRC Plan  
- **Part 10**: Present executive summary to stakeholders  
- **Part 11**: Document lessons learned and future steps

### 🔹 Days 98–100: Reflection & Wrap-Up
- Highlight key learnings and next steps
- Finalize professional documentation and GRC blueprint
