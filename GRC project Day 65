# Day 65: Task R-2 – Risk Analysis by the Authorizing Official (AO)

Welcome to **Day 65** of my 100 Days of GRC learning journey. Today, I took on the perspective of the **Authorizing Official (AO)** and practiced the critical skill of **risk analysis**. After assembling the authorization package for our OpenMRS-on-AWS project, it’s time to determine whether the system’s residual risk is acceptable enough to move forward with an Authorization to Operate (ATO).

##  What I Learned Today

In the RMF **Task R-2**, the AO evaluates the **residual risk** associated with operating the system. This isn't a retest of the system, but rather a senior-level judgment based on the following documents:

-  **System Security Plan (SSP)**
-  **Security Assessment Report (SAR)**
-  **Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)**
-  **Executive Summary**

As an AO, the primary question I must answer is:

> "Can we live with the current level of risk, based on what we know?"

##  Key Concepts & Insights

###  The AO’s Role

- The AO uses the package to **make a formal risk determination**, not just for technical compliance but for **business and mission impact**.
- Input may be gathered from stakeholders like the **CISO**, **Privacy Officer**, or **Risk Executive**, especially if enterprise or privacy-level risks are involved.

###  Residual Risk Analysis

Residual risk is what **remains after all controls have been applied**. The AO must weigh:
- Severity of remaining vulnerabilities (e.g., moderate or low)
- The presence of active mitigation plans in the POA&M
- The system's importance to the organization
- The organization's **risk tolerance thresholds**

##  Case Study: OpenMRS on AWS

Let’s say our AO is **Dr. Tran**, the CTO of the healthcare NGO implementing OpenMRS. Here's how she might approach this task:

1. **Review the Executive Summary**: Confirms no high-risk issues remain.
2. **Dive into the SAR**: Validates that remaining findings (like lack of MFA on admin accounts) are well-documented and medium-risk.
3. **Check the POA&M**: Confirms mitigation plans are in place for all open items, with acceptable timelines.

Dr. Tran might reach out to the system security team for clarifications. For example:

> _"You plan to enable MFA in 45 days – what safeguards are in place until then?"_

We explain:
- Admin access is currently IP-restricted.
- MFA setup is already in testing phase.

This dialogue ensures that **mitigation plans are realistic and active**, building trust in the process.

##  Sample Risk Determination Statement

> "The OpenMRS system presents a **moderate residual risk** to the organization’s operations and assets. All high-severity vulnerabilities have been remediated. Mitigation plans for moderate findings are documented in the POA&M and scheduled within 60 days."

This formal determination sets the stage for the next step: **risk response**.

##  Hands-On Exercise

###  Pretending to be an AO

Here are the three questions I would ask if I were an AO reviewing a web-based system:

1. **What’s the worst-case scenario if this system is breached?**
2. **Are there any open high-severity findings?**
3. **Do mitigation efforts in the POA&M align with organizational risk policy and deadlines?**

And here’s how I’d want them answered:
- No high-risk vulnerabilities remain.
- All moderate risks have mitigation milestones within 30–60 days.
- Interim safeguards (like IP whitelisting, logging, alerts) are in place.

##  Reflection

Switching into the AO mindset was a powerful learning experience.

As a builder or engineer, I tend to focus on **fixing problems** and **building functionality**.

But as an AO, the lens is different: I now think in terms of **organizational impact, mission alignment**, and **risk tolerance**.

This shift reminded me that **GRC professionals must bridge both perspectives**: technical precision and executive reasoning.

---

##  What’s Next?

Tomorrow in **Day 66**, I’ll continue with **Task R-3 – Risk Response**. Now that Dr. Tran has made her determination, the next step is deciding: **accept, mitigate further, transfer, or reject** the risk. It’s time to turn insights into action. 💼
