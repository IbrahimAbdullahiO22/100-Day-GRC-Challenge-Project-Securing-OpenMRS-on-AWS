# 📅 Day 5 – The GRC Triad: How Governance, Risk, and Compliance Interrelate | 100 Days of GRC

##  What I’ve Learned and Teach About the GRC Triad

This first week has been transformational. As I lead and teach within the GRC space, I now see more clearly how **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) must operate together** — not in silos — to build strong security programs.

Here’s the analogy I use with teams:

> GRC is a three-legged stool.  
> Without **G** (leadership and policy), there’s no direction.  
> Without **R** (risk management), there’s no prioritization.  
> Without **C** (compliance), there’s no accountability.  
> Knock out one leg — the stool falls. 

When done right, GRC provides stability and resilience.

##  Real-World Example: Encryption in OpenMRS

To teach this in context, I use our OpenMRS-on-AWS healthcare example:

### Governance (G)  
The leadership (Board, CIO, or IT Director) sets a clear **policy**:  
*"All ePHI in OpenMRS must be encrypted at rest and in transit."*

That’s **Governance** — setting the tone, writing the rules.

### Risk (R)  
That policy is in response to a key risk:  
*If attackers steal unencrypted patient data, there is high impact to privacy and reputation.*

By enforcing encryption, we **reduce the impact** of that risk. Even if a breach happens, encrypted data is useless to attackers.

That’s **Risk Management** in action — prioritizing the control that mitigates a high-impact risk.

### Compliance (C)  
HIPAA requires technical safeguards like encryption. By implementing this policy, we also meet those regulatory obligations.

That’s **Compliance** — ensuring the legal boxes are checked.

## 🎓 Key Teaching Insight

G → R → C works as a **feedback loop**:  

- Governance defines strategy  
- Risk identifies where that strategy must focus  
- Compliance ensures accountability — and influences new governance decisions  

When these are done **together**, security is strong and intentional.  
When done separately — gaps and inefficiencies emerge.

##  Hands-On Example (MFA for VPN Access)

Here’s a GRC triad I mapped for my own team’s project on **MFA for VPN**:

**Governance:**  
CIO mandates MFA on all remote VPN connections — written into IT security policy.

**Risk:**  
Addresses risk of stolen passwords — reduces likelihood of unauthorized access to internal systems.

**Compliance:**  
Satisfies insurance requirements (cyber policy mandates MFA), and helps meet NIST 800-171 requirements for authentication.

When I teach this, I remind teams:  
One good governance decision can **simultaneously reduce risk and ensure compliance** — saving time and resources.

## 🔍 Reflection

In this first week, I realized that many organizations tend to focus too much on **compliance** — chasing checkboxes — while neglecting **governance** and true **risk management**.

For me, **Governance (G)** is what I want to strengthen most — because when leadership drives security culture, everything else improves.  

And as a GRC leader, I’m most drawn to the **risk pillar** — I love identifying threats, prioritizing mitigations, and seeing risk reduction translate into stronger outcomes for patients and customers.

## Final Thought

> **When G, R, and C work together, security becomes proactive — not reactive.**  

That is the kind of GRC program I strive to build — and I will continue applying these principles in every project, whether deploying OpenMRS or advising enterprise security programs.

## What’s Next?

Next week, I’ll go deeper — applying GRC in **risk assessments** and governance frameworks.  
Looking forward to sharing and teaching as I continue this journey. 🚀
