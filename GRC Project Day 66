#  Day 66: Task R-3 – Risk Response

Welcome to Day 66! By now, the Authorizing Official (AO) has reviewed the system’s risks and made a risk determination. Today in **Task R-3**, we take the next step: defining how we respond to those risks.

This is where governance becomes action. Risk response is not just theory — it’s the moment we decide:

> **“Can we live with this risk, or must we reduce it?”**

##  Objectives of Task R-3

- Understand how to respond to identified residual risks.
- Distinguish between mitigation and risk acceptance.
- Document risk response decisions effectively.
- Align POA&M and system documentation with current status.

##  Two Core Risk Responses

In the context of the NIST RMF, there are two primary risk response paths:

###  Mitigation

When the risk is too high or violates organizational policy, we **reduce** it by implementing additional controls. For instance:

- **Issue:** OpenMRS lacks MFA for admin logins.
- **Response:** Require implementation of MFA within 30 days.
- **POA&M:** Milestones defined, deadlines set.
- **Reassessment:** Controls are re-tested to confirm efficacy.

Mitigation can also involve **interim measures** — such as IP whitelisting — while a longer fix is being deployed. Per NIST, mitigation steps and their outcomes should be reflected in updated SSP and SAR documentation.

###  Acceptance

When the **residual risk** is considered low or mitigation is impractical given the cost or impact, the AO may choose to **accept** the risk.

- **Only the AO can authorize acceptance**.
- Risk is still tracked (in SAR, risk register, etc.).
- Typically reserved for **low or moderate** findings only.

For example, a minor vulnerability in a legacy API might be accepted with the plan to sunset that feature within a quarter.

##  Scenario: Risk Response for OpenMRS on AWS

Let's apply this:

Dr. Tran, our AO, determines:

- All **high risks have been mitigated**.
- A few **moderate findings** remain:
  - Missing MFA for some admin accounts.
  - No API rate limiting.

### Dr. Tran's Risk Response Plan:

- **Mitigate:** MFA must be fully implemented **before go-live**.
- **Mitigate:** API rate limiting to be implemented **within 60 days**.
- **Accept:** Residual moderate risk during the 60-day window, contingent on interim measures (e.g., IP filtering).

These are documented in:
- A memo or authorization letter.
- The POA&M (with updated milestones).
- The SSP (updated to reflect MFA is now live).

##  When Risks Are Too High...

If any **high-risk** vulnerability had remained — like a critical flaw exposing PHI — Dr. Tran would have likely halted authorization entirely.

> **High risks must be mitigated before ATO can be issued.**

No shortcuts.

##  Documentation Updates

As mitigation actions are implemented:
- **SSP** sections are updated (e.g., access control changes).
- **POA&M** reflects new or completed items.
- **SAR** includes post-mitigation re-testing results.

Keeping these synchronized is part of **maintaining governance transparency**.

##  Hands-On Exercise

Pick a risk (real or imagined) and define two response options:

**Example:**
- **Risk:** Unpatched server with critical CVE.
- **Mitigation:** Apply patch within 48 hours.
- **Acceptance:** Temporarily accept risk while increasing monitoring (only if organizational policy allows).

Then ask:
- Would I sign off as AO on this?
- What interim controls make acceptance safer?

---

##  Reflection

Thinking like an AO is different from being a builder. It’s about **risk ownership**.

- Were your mitigation timelines realistic?
- Would you be comfortable accepting that risk?
- How would you explain your decision to leadership?

This task teaches us how to balance **security rigor** with **operational pragmatism**.

##  What’s Next?

Tomorrow, we’ll reach a pivotal milestone — **Task R-4: Authorization Decision**.

We’ll see how all our work, all our documents, and all our remediations come together in a formal **ATO (Authority to Operate)** decision.
