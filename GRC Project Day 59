# Day 59 – Task A-3 (Part 1): Perform Control Assessments (Technical)

Welcome to **Day 59** of my GRC learning journey! Today, I’m diving into the *Assess* phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) with a focus on **technical control assessments**. Using the OpenMRS-on-AWS case study, I’ll demonstrate how to verify that our security controls are truly working—not just assumed to be.

---

##  Today’s Goals

- **Identify** technical assessment techniques like vulnerability scanning, password policy enforcement, and encryption validation.  
- **Leverage** AWS-native tools such as **AWS Config** and **AWS Trusted Advisor**.  
- **Apply** hands-on control testing to the OpenMRS system hosted on AWS.

##  What Are Technical Control Assessments?

Technical assessments are *hands-on validations*—we don’t just “say” a control is in place; we *test* it.

According to [NIST SP 800-53A](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53a/rev-5/final), assessors rely on three methods:
- **Examine**: review artifacts or configs  
- **Interview**: talk to staff  
- **Test**: execute hands-on security checks  

Today we focus on **Test** — confirming controls work through active evaluation.

##  Our Architecture – OpenMRS on AWS

We’re operating OpenMRS in a cloud-hosted stack using:
- **EC2** instances for the app servers  
- **Amazon RDS** for the backend database  
- **S3 buckets** for logs/backups  
- **AWS WAF**, **IAM**, and **Security Groups** for layered security  

Each of these components must pass technical scrutiny.

---

##  Key Assessment Techniques

###  Vulnerability Scanning

Using tools like **Amazon Inspector**, **OWASP ZAP**, or **Nessus**, we:
- Scan EC2 and RDS for known CVEs
- Detect misconfigurations or unpatched software
- Validate controls such as CM-2 (Baseline Configuration) and SI-2 (Flaw Remediation)

> _Example: A scan revealed an outdated OpenMRS module and an unpatched Log4j library. That flagged a remediation requirement under control SI-2._

---

###  Password Policy Testing

We validated strong authentication under AC-2 and IA-5:
- Attempted to create weak passwords via IAM and OpenMRS app
- Confirmed complexity, lockout, and expiration settings
- Ensured policies align with organizational baselines

> _Tested password "OpenMRS123!" was accepted in one test case—indicating a control gap._

---

### Encryption and Network Configuration

Under SC-12, SC-13, and SC-28:
- Verified **RDS encryption** at rest  
- Checked **S3 bucket policies** for default SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption  
- Confirmed **TLS/HTTPS** enforced across endpoints  
- Reviewed **Security Groups** for least-privilege access

> _One EC2 instance had port 22 open to 0.0.0.0/0 — a red flag for misconfiguration under SC-7._

---

## AWS Security Tools

### AWS Config

- Validates that resources stay in secure state  
- Example rule: “Ensure all EBS volumes are encrypted”  
- Helps maintain continuous compliance

### AWS Trusted Advisor

- Flags:
  - Open ports
  - Over-permissive S3 buckets
  - Root users lacking MFA
- Even the free tier provides valuable insights

---

##  Optional Penetration Testing

In alignment with [AWS Penetration Testing Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/), we simulated:

- **SQL injection attempts** on OpenMRS forms  
- **Cross-site scripting** (XSS)  
- **WAF evasion techniques**  

> _Penetration testing validated the effectiveness of AWS WAF and OpenMRS input validation routines._

---

##  Evidence Collection for RMF

All findings, screenshots, logs, and reports were documented to support Task A-3 and future POA&Ms (Plan of Actions and Milestones). Controls assessed included:

| Control ID | Control Name             | Status       | Method   | Tool Used        |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| AC-2       | Account Management       | Partial Pass | Test     | AWS Console      |
| SC-12/13   | Cryptographic Protection | Pass         | Examine  | AWS Config       |
| CM-2       | Configuration Management | Fail         | Test     | Amazon Inspector |

---

##  Reflection

This technical assessment session was a reminder that **security is not static**. Tools like Trusted Advisor and Config help automate checks, but it’s the **hands-on testing** that uncovers real exposure.

> _Most eye-opening moment: discovering the lack of encryption on our backup S3 bucket. That’s getting patched today._

---

##  Hands-On Exercise

If you want to try this too:

1. **Run AWS Trusted Advisor**  
   _Check for open ports, MFA on root, public S3 buckets._

2. **Inspect Password Policy**  
   _Reject weak passwords. Enforce complexity and rotation._

3. **Verify Encryption**  
   _Check that S3, EBS, and RDS are encrypted by default._

Stay tuned for **Day 60**, where we’ll shift from tech to talk — focusing on interviews, documentation reviews, and the human element in control assessments.

> Security isn’t just about firewalls and encryption. It’s also about how people use and protect systems every day.
