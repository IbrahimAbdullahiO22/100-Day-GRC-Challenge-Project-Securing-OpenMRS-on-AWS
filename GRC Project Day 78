#  Day 78 – Managing POA&Ms and Risk Acceptance Over Time

Welcome to the final day of this GRC journey!   
After weeks of securing, monitoring, and decommissioning systems, we now arrive at one of the most crucial ongoing practices: **managing POA&Ms (Plans of Action and Milestones)** and **risk acceptance**.

---

##  What Is a POA&M?

A **POA&M** is a structured plan that captures security findings, outlines steps to remediate them, and assigns accountability. If a control isn’t immediately satisfied, we don’t ignore it — we **document it**, own it, and track it to closure.

> It includes:
- The identified **weakness**
- A **remediation plan**
- Required **resources**
- Milestones and **target completion dates**
- **Progress status** (e.g., Open, In Progress, Completed)

---

###  Example from the OpenMRS-on-AWS Project:

**Weakness:** MFA not enabled for all AWS admin accounts  
**Plan:** Deploy AWS MFA tokens and train users  
**Resources:** IAM engineer + training sessions  
**Milestones:**  
- Pilot MFA with 2 users by Q1  
- Full deployment by Q2  
**Completion Target:** June 30, 2025

As work progresses, we log updates. Example:
> _"Status: 50% complete – 5 out of 10 admins enrolled in MFA."_  
This keeps stakeholders informed and shows accountability in real-time.

##  What Happens When You Can’t Fix a Risk?

Sometimes, despite best efforts, you **can’t immediately fix a weakness** — or it’s not worth the cost or impact. This is where **Risk Acceptance** enters the picture.

>  Risk Acceptance is not a failure — it’s a **formal, documented business decision**.

###  When to Accept a Risk:

- The risk is **low-impact** or **within tolerance**
- A fix would be **disruptive** or **unfeasible** short-term
- **Compensating controls** reduce overall exposure

###  Real-World Example:

> Risk: OpenMRS backup database is unencrypted  
> Fix: Encryption degrades performance; backup access is restricted  
> Acceptance:  
> _"CISO accepted the risk on 2025-04-30. Compensating controls in place. Revisit by 2026-04-30."_

This goes into the POA&M (or a Risk Register) as a tracked, reviewed decision — not a forgotten issue.

##  Hands-On Practice

### Sample POA&M Update Entry

**POA&M Item:** Enable encryption for all OpenMRS database backups  
**Initial Deadline:** May 31, 2025  
**Update:**  
> _"Status: 50% complete — encryption enabled on test and dev backups. Production backups in progress. Interim risk of unencrypted prod backups formally accepted by CIO until final encryption deadline of June 30, 2025."_  

This update shows:
- Progress made  
- Remaining risk  
- Who approved acceptance and when  

---

## Why POA&Ms Matter

POA&Ms help ensure that issues:
- Don’t slip through the cracks  
- Are tracked to closure  
- Are prioritized with context  
- Are visible to decision-makers

They keep security teams **accountable** and **focused** on real progress — not just compliance checkboxes.

---

##  Reflection

>  “Is a POA&M just paperwork — or is it power?”

For me, a well-managed POA&M is **a living roadmap**. It turns good intentions into tangible actions and reminds teams that **security is an ongoing commitment**. Even when risks are accepted, they’re not invisible — they’re **monitored, owned, and revisited**.

Not every weakness gets fixed right away — and that’s okay. What matters is transparency, deliberate decision-making, and continuous improvement.

---

## Today’s Goal

Understand how to track security weaknesses over time, prioritize remediation, and use risk acceptance **wisely** — not as a shortcut, but as a strategic business decision supported by documentation and review.

##  Wrapping Up the GRC Journey

This marks the final day in this 78-day GRC journey. From system authorization to monitoring, reporting, and now risk accountability, I’ve built both hands-on experience and leadership insight.

Remember:  
> **GRC is not a checkbox. It’s a culture.**  
Keep growing, keep learning, and keep securing what matters.

Stay vigilant. Stay resilient. Stay committed.
