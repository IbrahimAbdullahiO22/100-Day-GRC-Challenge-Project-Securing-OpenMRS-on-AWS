# Day 61: Task A-4 – Security Assessment Report (SAR)

Welcome to **Day 61** of my 100-Day GRC journey!  
Today marks a significant milestone — turning all the technical and procedural assessments I’ve performed into an official **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** for our OpenMRS-on-AWS case study.

This document represents the culmination of weeks of planning, control selection, and testing — now organized into a report that communicates system risk posture to decision-makers.

---

##  Today’s Learning Objectives

- **Understand the SAR’s Purpose**  
  Grasp the critical role this document plays in the RMF process and how it informs the Authorizing Official (AO).

- **Know the SAR’s Structure**  
  Learn to document which controls are satisfied, which are deficient, and how to evaluate and communicate the associated risks.

- **Apply to Real-World Example**  
  Showcase mock findings from our OpenMRS AWS implementation to demonstrate effective SAR documentation techniques.

##  What Is a Security Assessment Report?

A **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** is the formal output of the **RMF Task A-4**. It summarizes:
- What was assessed,
- Which controls passed,
- What deficiencies were discovered,
- How serious those risks are,
- And recommendations for remediation.

The SAR provides **evidence-based findings** for leadership to make a risk-informed authorization decision.

##  What Goes Into a SAR?

A standard SAR includes:

###  System Overview  
Brief description of the system:  
> *“OpenMRS is a cloud-hosted electronic medical record system deployed on AWS for Clinic XYZ. It consists of EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 backups, and is protected via AWS IAM, WAF, and security groups.”*

###  Assessment Scope and Method  
We assessed selected NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls using **Examine, Interview, and Test** methods across both technical and non-technical domains. Tools used include:
- Amazon Inspector
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- Document review
- Staff interviews

###  Summary of Results  

| Control Status  | Count |
|-----------------|-------|
| Satisfied       | 90    |
| Deficient       | 10    |
| High Risk       | 1     |
| Moderate Risk   | 4     |
| Low Risk        | 5     |

###  Detailed Findings  
Each control with a deficiency is documented with:
- Control ID and Name
- Description of the issue
- Associated evidence
- Risk level
- Recommendation (optional in SAR, expanded later in POA&M)

##  Example Findings from OpenMRS on AWS

###  Finding #1  
**Control:** SC-13: Cryptographic Protection  
**Status:** Deficient  
**Description:** Automated RDS database snapshots were not encrypted by default.  
**Risk:** Moderate  
**Evidence:** AWS Console inspection revealed unencrypted snapshots for production RDS instances.  
**Recommendation:** Enable encryption for automated RDS snapshots and enforce snapshot encryption policies moving forward.

---

###  Finding #2  
**Control:** IA-5: Authenticator Management  
**Status:** Deficient  
**Description:** Weak password policy was enforced by default in both OpenMRS and AWS IAM.  
**Risk:** High  
**Evidence:** Test users were able to set passwords like `Password123!` without rejection. IAM policy only required 6 characters.  
**Recommendation:** Update IAM and OpenMRS password policies to enforce complexity, 12+ character minimum, and MFA for admin roles.

---

###  Example Satisfied Control  
**Control:** AC-2: Account Management  
**Status:** Satisfied  
**Evidence:** All active accounts were reviewed quarterly and removed if unused. Access permissions were appropriately scoped per least privilege via IAM roles and OpenMRS user roles.

---

##  Risk Ratings – What Do They Mean?

| Risk Level | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **High**   | Immediate remediation required; could lead to significant compromise. |
| **Moderate** | Important to resolve; exploitable with some effort. |
| **Low**    | Minor issue; mostly administrative or unlikely threat vector. |

Risk levels are based on a combination of **likelihood** and **impact**, following our organization's risk matrix.

##  Hands-On Exercise: Write a Mini SAR Entry

Here’s a practical entry I wrote as part of today’s task:

> **Control:** AU-6 (Audit Log Review)  
> **Status:** Deficient  
> **Description:** While CloudTrail logging was enabled, the team lacked a routine review process.  
> **Risk:** Moderate  
> **Recommendation:** Implement a scheduled weekly log review and set up AWS CloudWatch alarms for anomalies.

##  Reflection: What I Learned

Writing an SAR forces clarity and accountability. It’s one thing to assess controls — it’s another to explain them in a way that leadership understands and acts on. I found it especially challenging to **balance technical precision with executive clarity**.

For instance, it’s easy to say “RDS wasn’t encrypted,” but much harder to explain why that’s a **moderate risk** and what the implications could be for patient data.

This exercise reminded me that **GRC work lives in the details** — but decision-makers live in the summary. We must serve both.

## 📅 Coming Up: Day 62 – Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)

Now that we've reported the gaps, the next step is to **act on them**. On Day 62, I’ll share how we build a Plan of Action and Milestones to remediate issues found during the assessment and prepare the system for Authorization to Operate (ATO). Stay tuned!
