# 📅 Day 43 – Task C-1: System Description

##  "We Can’t Protect What We Can’t Define."

One of the most powerful lessons I’ve learned in GRC is this: **clarity precedes control**. Before you can manage risk, enforce compliance, or design security controls, you have to clearly define **what** you're securing.

That’s why Task C-1 of the NIST RMF – **System Description** – matters so much. It’s not just a checkbox in the Categorize step. It’s where we set the tone for every decision that follows.

Today, I took a deep dive into the heart of OpenMRS, our cloud-hosted EHR system, and translated its operational reality into a clear, security-relevant profile.

## 🩺 Case Study: OpenMRS on AWS

Here’s how I’ve documented our system, in my own words:

> **OpenMRS is an open-source Electronic Health Records system deployed on AWS to support clinical workflows at MyClinic.** It handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and supports authorized medical staff via a secure web interface.

### 🔍 System Profile (As I See It)

- **System Name**: MyClinic OpenMRS EHR
- **Purpose**: To manage patient data and clinical operations securely
- **Users**: Authorized healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, IT admins)
- **Environment**: AWS Cloud (EC2, RDS, S3, Route 53, ACM, WAF)
- **Data Sensitivity**: High – includes PHI governed by HIPAA
- **Architecture**:
  - Web Tier: EC2 + Apache Tomcat + OpenMRS App
  - Data Tier: MySQL on Amazon RDS (multi-AZ enabled)
  - Backup: Amazon S3 with encryption and lifecycle rules
  - DNS/SSL: AWS Route 53 + ACM
  - Network: VPC with private subnets, NAT gateway, security groups
  - Security: AWS WAF + AWS Shield
- **Authorization Boundary**: Everything in our AWS-hosted EHR deployment
- **Compliance Context**: HIPAA, internal healthcare IT policies
- **Key Roles**:
  - **System Owner**: Dr. Alice Smith (Health IT)
  - **System Admin**: Myself – Ibrahim Abdullahi (GRC Lead)

This description lives in our **System Security Plan (SSP)** and will evolve with the system. But already, it’s enabled alignment across our security, compliance, and ops teams.

## 🧩 Why This Matters

Describing a system isn’t just an administrative task. It’s a **leadership move**.

When I clearly document system boundaries, components, and sensitivity, I’m enabling:

 Risk analysts to apply accurate categorization  
 Engineers to scope controls properly  
 Auditors to assess compliance with context  
 Executives to see the business impact clearly

It’s how I make sure no one is guessing – **everyone knows what’s on the table**.

## ✍️ My Practice Exercise

As part of today’s hands-on, I practiced building system profiles for other environments I’ve worked with – even a personal lab setup. It reinforced a critical insight:

> “If you can’t describe a system in one page, you probably can’t secure it.”

So, I always start with:
- What is it?
- Who uses it?
- Where does it live?
- What data does it touch?
- Who’s responsible?

Simple. Actionable. Clear.

## 💬 Final Reflection

In my role, I'm committed to **making GRC approachable, effective, and embedded into how we build systems from Day 1**.  
Task C-1 isn’t a side note. It’s how I lead by bringing visibility, clarity, and ownership into the conversation early.

Now that the system is clearly described, I’m ready for the next step: **categorizing its risk impact** using FIPS 199. Let’s keep the momentum going.
