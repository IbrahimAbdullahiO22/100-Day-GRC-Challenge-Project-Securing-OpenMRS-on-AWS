#  Day 95: Capstone Part 9 ‚Äì Compile the GRC Plan Document | 100 Days of GRC

##  Objective

Today marks a major milestone: compiling the **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Plan Document** for our OpenMRS-on-AWS project. After weeks of designing security controls, identifying risks, defining policies, and establishing monitoring procedures, it‚Äôs time to **bring it all together into a single, cohesive document**.

This isn‚Äôt just paperwork ‚Äî it‚Äôs our **living blueprint** for securing OpenMRS and staying compliant over time. This GRC Plan will serve as a guide for stakeholders, team members, auditors, and future administrators who manage or assess the security of this system.

---

##  Purpose of the GRC Plan

> ‚ÄúWhat is the system, what could go wrong, and how are we protecting it?‚Äù

The GRC Plan answers those questions. It documents our structured, proactive approach to managing security and compliance, including:
- System scope and environment
- Risk identification and treatment
- Security controls implemented
- Policy and procedural governance
- Monitoring and audit preparation

By consolidating our efforts into one document, we make it **readable, transferable, and actionable**.

##  GRC Plan Document Structure

### 1. **Introduction & System Overview**
> *‚ÄúWhat is OpenMRS, where does it live, and why does it matter?‚Äù*

- **System**: OpenMRS is an open-source electronic medical record (EMR) system used by Clinic X to manage patient care.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using EC2, RDS (MySQL), S3, CloudWatch, IAM, and VPC configurations.
- **Scope**: This plan applies to the OpenMRS application, supporting AWS infrastructure, storage, and administrative access controls.

---

### 2. **Roles & Responsibilities**
> *‚ÄúWho is responsible for what?‚Äù*

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **System Owner** | Oversees OpenMRS implementation and budget (e.g., Clinic IT Director) |
| **AWS Administrator** | Manages cloud infrastructure, backups, IAM, and patching |
| **GRC Lead (You)** | Owns the GRC Plan, policies, and continuous monitoring |
| **Security Analyst** | Performs log reviews, alerts, and vulnerability scans |
| **End-Users (Clinicians)** | Follow secure usage policies; report anomalies |

---

### 3. **Risk Assessment Summary**
> *‚ÄúWhat could go wrong and what have we done about it?‚Äù*

| Risk | Rating | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| SQL Injection Attack | High | WAF enabled, input validation enforced |
| Unauthorized Admin Access | High | IAM roles restricted, MFA required |
| Misconfigured S3 Bucket | High | AWS Config alerts, access audits |
| Server Outage | Medium | Multi-AZ RDS, backup EC2 AMI |
| Insider Misuse | Medium | Audit logs, least privilege enforced |

 A full risk register is available in the appendices.

---

### 4. **Control Implementation Summary**
> *‚ÄúWhat security controls protect the system?‚Äù*

**Access Control**
- IAM policies with least privilege
- Role-Based Access Control in OpenMRS
- MFA enforced for AWS and administrative logins

**Data Protection**
- RDS encrypted at rest
- HTTPS and SSL/TLS enforced in transit
- S3 buckets configured with encryption and versioning

**Monitoring**
- AWS CloudTrail logs all actions
- AWS CloudWatch alarms configured for anomalies
- OpenMRS audit logs enabled and reviewed

**Incident Response**
- NIST-aligned IRP in place (Prepare, Detect, Contain, Eradicate, Recover, Learn)
- Response roles defined; communication playbook prepared

**Backup & Recovery**
- Automated daily backups to encrypted S3
- Quarterly backup restore tests documented

---

### 5. **Policies & Procedures**
> *‚ÄúWhat rules and steps guide secure behavior?‚Äù*

- **Access Control Policy** ‚Äì Updated to reflect OpenMRS/AWS user management
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** ‚Äì Defines how to handle security events
- **Backup & Recovery Procedure** ‚Äì Details backup frequency, testing, and restoration
- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** ‚Äì Defines proper use expectations for end users
- **Change Management Procedure** ‚Äì Governs updates to OpenMRS or AWS configuration
- **Training Plan** ‚Äì Role-based, HIPAA-aligned, includes phishing simulation and onboarding

Policies are referenced here and stored in **Appendix B**.

---

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring & Audit Plan**
> *‚ÄúHow do we keep this plan effective and audit-ready?‚Äù*

| Task | Frequency | Owner | Audit Evidence |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Review AWS CloudTrail logs | Weekly | Security Analyst | Log review email or report |
| Verify backup completion | Daily | DevOps | Screenshot or success log |
| Run vulnerability scans | Monthly | IT Admin | Nessus report or scan output |
| IAM access review | Quarterly | GRC Lead | Signed access review form |
| Restore from backup (test) | Quarterly | DevOps | Validation report |

- Monitoring tasks scheduled via secure calendar
- Evidence stored in protected audit repository
- Audit readiness includes pre-audit checklist, IRP drills, policy reviews

---

### 7. **Appendices**
> *Supporting docs to avoid crowding the main document.*

- **Appendix A**: Full Risk Register (detailed list of risks, scores, treatment, owner)
- **Appendix B**: Full Text of Policies (Access, IR, AUP, etc.)
- **Appendix C**: AWS Architecture Diagram  
- **Appendix D**: Monitoring Checklist Template  
- **Appendix E**: Compliance Mapping (HIPAA & NIST 800-53 references)
