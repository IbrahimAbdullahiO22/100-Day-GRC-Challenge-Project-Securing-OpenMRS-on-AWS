#  Day 69: Task M-1 – Monitor System & Environment Changes

Welcome to **Day 69** of my 100-Day GRC journey!

Today marks our first step into the **Monitor** phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). Now that OpenMRS has received its **Authorization to Operate (ATO)** and is in production, our focus shifts to making sure it stays secure.  

This is where **Task M-1 – Monitor System & Environment Changes** becomes essential. It’s not just about watching for known threats — it’s about staying alert to **anything that changes** and could affect security or privacy posture.

---

##  Why Monitor System and Environment Changes?

The truth is simple: **Change is inevitable.**  

- Systems get updated  
- Infrastructure evolves  
- Threats become more sophisticated  
- Business needs shift  

Even the smallest change — like an opened port in an AWS Security Group — can undermine months of hardening work. That’s why M-1 emphasizes **proactive awareness**.

##  Applying M-1 to OpenMRS on AWS

Let’s explore what this looks like in practice. Suppose I'm managing an OpenMRS deployment hosted on AWS for a healthcare NGO. I would track changes in two key areas:

###  1. Technical System Changes

These include:

- OS updates (e.g., Ubuntu patches)
- OpenMRS core or module upgrades
- AWS configuration tweaks (e.g., modifying EC2, RDS, or S3 permissions)
- Deployment of new scripts or APIs
- Changes in IAM roles or security group settings

**Monitoring Techniques:**

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Tracks who made what change and when  
- **AWS Config**: Detects configuration drift against baselines  
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Aggregates alerts and changes for correlation  
- **Code deployment logs**: Reveal unexpected updates or failed rollbacks  

---

### 2. Environmental Changes

These include:

- Organizational changes (e.g., new clinic location, new staff)
- Policy updates (e.g., new HIPAA interpretation, stricter MFA policies)
- Regulatory shifts (e.g., GDPR/HIPAA alignment, state-level changes)
- Threat landscape shifts (e.g., ransomware surge targeting healthcare)

**Monitoring Techniques:**

- **Threat intelligence feeds**
- **Policy review cadence (quarterly or annual)**
- **Regular security awareness and training feedback**
- **Business continuity plans** updated to reflect new environments

## Blending Process and Technology

A strong GRC leader knows that **technology alone is not enough**. We also need **governance processes** in place:

-  **Change Management Policy**: Every change must go through approval, logging, and rollback planning  
-  **Configuration Management Plan**: Defines which configurations are approved and monitored  
-  **Security Impact Analysis (SIA)**: Evaluates whether a proposed change will affect the system's security controls  
-  **Stakeholder Review**: For high-risk or impactful changes  

By pairing automated detection tools with structured decision-making processes, we reduce the chance that a silent change erodes trust or opens a vulnerability.

##  Reflection

If I were managing OpenMRS today, here are three **environmental/system changes** I’d monitor closely:

1. **Change in firewall rules** on AWS that open port 8080 to the internet  
2. **Deployment of unverified OpenMRS modules** by development teams  
3. **Expansion to new clinic locations** with unclear network segmentation or physical security practices  

For each, I’d implement alerts via CloudTrail and AWS Config, require change tickets in our ITSM tool, and hold monthly change control board (CCB) meetings to review trends.

---

##  Today’s Goal Recap

Task M-1 taught me to think like a **continuous risk assessor**.  

Security is not a one-time setup — it’s a **living, breathing process**. I now understand that:

- **System changes** must be logged, reviewed, and monitored  
- **Environmental changes** must be anticipated and incorporated into strategy  
- **Tooling and policy** go hand in hand to create real-time visibility

##  Hands-On Activity

Design a quick monitoring checklist for your system:

| Change Type | Example | How It’s Monitored |
|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| Technical | EC2 IAM Role change | AWS CloudTrail alert |
| Policy | New MFA mandate | Change advisory review |
| Threat | Ransomware alert for healthcare | Threat Intel + SOC updates |
| Network | New VPN endpoint added | Network scan + config baseline diff |

## Teaser for Day 70

Tomorrow, we continue our Monitor phase by diving into **Task M-2 – Ongoing Control Assessments**.  

It’s not enough to know something changed — we must assess whether our **controls still work** as expected after those changes. See you then!
