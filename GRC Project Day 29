# 📅 Day 29 – Prioritizing Systems by Impact (FIPS 199)

## 🧭 Leadership Insight: Prioritization Is Power in GRC

Not all systems carry the same weight — and effective cybersecurity leadership means knowing **where to focus first**.

Today, I explored **Task P-6 of the NIST RMF** and FIPS 199 — the foundation for categorizing information systems by impact level across:

- 🔐 **Confidentiality**
- 🧮 **Integrity**
- ⚙️ **Availability**

This step ensures that systems like OpenMRS, which handle **sensitive patient data**, are given the heightened security attention and resources they rightfully deserve.

## 📘 FIPS 199 – Security Impact Categories

| Impact Level | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low**      | Limited adverse effect (minor inconvenience or operational disruption)     |
| **Moderate** | Serious adverse effect (harm to operations, finances, or privacy)           |
| **High**     | Severe or catastrophic impact (loss of life, critical missions, legal harm) |

### 🏥 Case Study: OpenMRS (Electronic Medical Records System)

Here’s how I evaluated the impact levels for OpenMRS in a clinical environment:

| Security Objective | Impact Level | Justification                                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality**| High         | Exposure of PHI (e.g. HIV status, mental health data) could cause **serious harm** and violate HIPAA |
| **Integrity**      | High         | Tampering with records could lead to **incorrect treatments or diagnoses**                     |
| **Availability**   | Moderate–High| Downtime could **delay care**, especially in under-resourced clinics without paper backups     |

> ✅ As a GRC leader, I categorize OpenMRS as a **High-Impact System**, demanding **rigorous security controls, increased oversight, and continuous monitoring**.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

This step of prioritizing systems by impact helps answer key leadership questions:

- Where should we **invest the most** in cybersecurity?
- Which systems, if breached, would **pose the greatest threat** to lives or the business?
- How do we align limited **budgets and resources** to protect what matters most?

> “Cybersecurity strategy is triage. Impact categorization ensures we secure the crown jewels before locking the broom closet.” 🛡️

## ✍️ Hands-On Application

**Exercise Response**:
> _“I rate OpenMRS’s confidentiality as **High**, because unauthorized disclosure of patient health data could cause significant harm to individuals, breach public trust, and result in regulatory violations.”_

## 🧠 Reflection as a GRC Professional

Impact-level thinking trains your mindset to:

- Analyze **business-critical risks**
- Communicate threats to **executive leadership**
- Justify controls and budget decisions based on **tangible risk impact**

It’s not just theory — it’s how effective security programs scale and stay aligned with mission objectives.

> “Impact-first thinking is what transforms reactive compliance into proactive risk leadership.”
