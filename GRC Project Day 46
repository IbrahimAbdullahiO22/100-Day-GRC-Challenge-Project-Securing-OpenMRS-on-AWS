# üìÖ Day 46 ‚Äì Task S-1: Selecting the Moderate Baseline | 100 Days of GRC

##  Moving From Categorization to Controls

As a GRC leader, one thing I‚Äôve internalized about RMF is this: **Categorization without controls is just theory**. The real test of risk management starts when we begin shaping the system‚Äôs defenses. That‚Äôs why today‚Äôs focus ‚Äî selecting the appropriate baseline ‚Äî is such a critical leadership moment.

Now that we‚Äôve formally categorized our OpenMRS system as MODERATE (Task C-3 signed and approved ‚úÖ), my role is to chart the path toward ensuring this EHR system is protected at a level commensurate with its sensitivity and importance.

##  Why Use a Baseline?

I often explain to teams that a **baseline** is not bureaucracy ‚Äî it‚Äôs a form of professional wisdom.

> *It‚Äôs what seasoned practitioners have already figured out about what works at different risk levels.*

NIST SP 800-53B gives us that head start. For our MODERATE system, adopting the **MODERATE baseline** is the smart move:

Avoids reinventing the wheel  
Ensures comprehensive coverage  
Aligns with regulatory expectations (HIPAA, FISMA Moderate mappings)  
Gives auditors and stakeholders a trusted benchmark

Leadership in this phase means recognizing when to leverage standards vs. when to tailor (more on that in tomorrow‚Äôs Task S-1 Part 2).

##ÔøΩ What‚Äôs in the MODERATE Baseline?

As I reviewed the control families today, here are some of the key protections we‚Äôll implement for OpenMRS:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Access Control (AC)  
- **AC-2**: Rigorous user account management  
- **AC-6**: Least privilege enforcement  
- MFA for remote or privileged users ‚Äî critical for a cloud-based EHR

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Audit & Accountability (AU)  
- **AU-2, AU-6**: Detailed logging of access to PHI  
- Required for HIPAA, but also key for forensic readiness

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Incident Response (IR)  
- **IR-1 through IR-4**: Documented and tested incident response plan  
- We must be prepared to respond to potential breaches

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Contingency Planning (CP)  
- **CP-9**: Reliable encrypted backups (daily S3 snapshots + tested recovery)  
- **CP-7**: AWS multi-AZ for availability  
- Patients can‚Äôt wait ‚Äî care continuity matters

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ System & Communications Protection (SC)  
- **SC-12, SC-13**: Encrypt PHI in transit (TLS 1.2+ across all web traffic)  
- **SC-28**: Encrypt PHI at rest (RDS encryption + EC2 volume encryption)

##  My Perspective as a Leader

Selecting this baseline also means thinking **beyond just compliance**:

- **Resilience** ‚Äî How do we ensure continuity of patient care?
- **Trust** ‚Äî How do we uphold patient privacy and public confidence?
- **Operational Impact** ‚Äî How do we balance controls with usability for clinical staff?

I view NIST‚Äôs baseline not as a ceiling, but as **a floor to build upon**. We can (and should) enhance it ‚Äî especially in healthcare contexts where human lives are involved.

## Reflection

In my personal practice, I see baselines much like **pre-flight checklists for pilots**:

 You follow them religiously ‚Äî because you know they‚Äôre there to keep the mission safe.  
 You also adapt them when new conditions emerge ‚Äî because static defenses are brittle.

As a GRC leader, I commit to never treating baselines as ‚Äúcheckboxes‚Äù ‚Äî but as **living safeguards** that evolve with the system and the threat landscape.

---

##  What‚Äôs Next?

With our MODERATE baseline selected, I‚Äôll now lead the **tailoring process**:

‚û°Ô∏è Map specific HIPAA overlays  
‚û°Ô∏è Consider control enhancements where needed  
‚û°Ô∏è Clarify shared responsibilities between AWS and our team  
‚û°Ô∏è Document tailoring decisions (so nothing gets lost downstream)

Baseline chosen. Leadership mindset engaged. üöÄ
